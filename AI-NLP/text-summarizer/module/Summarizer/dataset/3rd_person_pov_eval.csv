Yes redux. I am learning redux so there also I've gone through the documentation and the videos and uh similar blogs
similar to react blog was created using react and redux integration I have
"attached that as well, there are several other things that I'll like to go today and moreover the framework part, we have come with a basic skeleton framework so Faisal will be able to "
"Tell more on that. Say uh Pandu do you have experience on redux? React?  Yes yes I have react, redux experience, so Avijit you can uh take help from Pandu. Yes sure. And Avijit maybe the screen which Venkatesh has sent right. Yes. You can start working on that creating the HTML in react and redux. Okay. Before that actually Jain before that actually the skeleton needs to be finalized right? Yeah we can do that i mean yeah we can uh mean the skeleton we can have a call with Sachin. Rajah what do you suggest uh you can take a review on the skeleton for react and redux? or we can have a call with Sachin? Who is Sachin? Sachin Date, Yeah Sachin Date. No no no no"
"No no no. Uh HIVE, as he wouldn't know anything about that. I need to sit down with Jatin and Pandu and then I need to update Rahul right. So I need to see for me the most priority screen is the screen where they're able to query a single request okay? If hundreds of requests have been uploaded and submit so that is 1, once we get that bifurcation of having a single request, the problem Sarika & Nikita are facing ever since almost like 4 Sprints i think, 3 Sprints back. So Rahul this is just to update you Sarika & Nikita they're not able to work in parallel okay. Right. Okay. So this will, this is the first thing i want to remove as a blocker as a part of the next Sprint, if we can get that simple screen where they can have these request files to download or to view them seperately so Sarika is giving request 123, Nikit should be free to give request 236, correct?"
"yeah makes sense, otherwise just waste of time or one has to sit idle. Correct."
So that is where I want to sit down with Jatin and Pandu to see that screen burst right
Yeah I have created a enabler for this for the next Sprint. Maybe sure sure user story is fine I am not
Sure sure user story is fine. I am not a process guy. User story is fine if you're recording it but that's just my priority. So that Rahul is you know kind of communicated that you know this can solve a lot  
"of road blocks down the road. Yeah okay sure. Yeah just to add to that what Avijit and me was saying was we have actually created a Skeleton for react like where everything should where the screen should go where the re-usable component should go how redux should be, Is this Faisal? yes yes Faisal. Yeah."
"Alright Faisal. Let me know when you're speaking, I don't usually look at the screen and I keep looking at people. Yeah yeah definitely have a have a what do you call? Run off with me ok? Yes yes so yeah and me & Jatin and uh then we can give you updates and to see and in that way Rahul can plan this Sprint better."
"Yes yes today will you be available? I mean the skeleton we kind of have it ready, to see how we've defined about the structures and how we'll be planning to, I mean redux is also already integrated."
Sure uh I have to check up this time let's not hijack this call maybe after this call you can send me a ping and we'll see if I can meet today or tomorrow. All right. Okay I have a couple of interviews. And next?
"We have 10 minutes more we can drop off here I think I have got all the updates, you guys can continue. Okay"
"the 10 minutes. Hey great, hey great Rahul thank you"
"So guys uh if you guys you know other people can drop off you know, let Rajah, Faisal continue. And Pandu, I need Pandu. Yeah Pandu, Pandu will be here Yeah obviously Pandu will be here. Avijit should also be here I think."
"Rajah can we active on this call? So later, yeah I'll"
"Yeah yes sure have a look at it, that's not a problem, but make sure you're able to understand and taking first what they're telling and then we can get"
"give them the modifications. Sure All right. So I'm presenting my screen, basically what we've planned is, we're going to have a API folder and we're going to ride all the axios calls here and we can have our helper methods here basically get post so there will be no actual API calls here, wherever you want to call the API calls, you just use these helper methods and we are going to, we are planning to use redux right? We can have a folder called for this is basically redux folder store, we can have a actions, and actions are basically they are asynchronous actions, we can just import this which class there and start using these helper methods okay in actions and then all the reducers will come inside the reducer folders. So for every screen i have a seperate file as actions and seperate file for reducers. Okay okay, and for screens. "
"also we'll have a separate folder for each screen will have it's own folder, it's own index dot. Okay you want to decouple in such a way right? Yes yes. Okay and this"
