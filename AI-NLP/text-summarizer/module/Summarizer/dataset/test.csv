Yep. Yep. Okay. Awesome. Yeah. ,"Yes, Awesome."
"Yeah, I think, um, you know, I feel that, you know, if you go to that definition earlier, John, yet you had that workOS is, uh, can you do, if you don't mind, can you go to the slide that you had, the definition of workOS? Yeah. So a low-code AI developer platform and everything. I think it's beyond AI.",WorkOS is a low-code AI developer platform
Yep. I think Sydney. ,"Yes, I think Sydney."
"Tweaking and supervised learning and all that stuff.  Yeah.  All right. Maybe, maybe just, uh, go to the high component here, the next, next slide for the hell of the world. So, so look, this is, I'll be, I'll be completely honest with everyone. This is my take on how I'm seeing things unfold based off of the conversations that we've been having in the past the past week. And what, what is starting to do is at least. ",This is my take on how I'm seeing things unfold based off of the conversations that we've been having in the past the past week regarding tweaking and supervised learning.
"Among the, the, the things here that we wanted to take advantage.  Did you have any Neo? And the D is how do we hook up the developer portal in such a way to each of these, these panels and functionality? ",How to connect the developer portal to each of these panels and functionality?
"Well, you know, I think one of the things here is, is we, we're not going to get to any great level of detail today because, you know, there's just so much richness to the, to this environment and the tooling and the design approach. Um, let me just say that I've, I've spent, I've spent a fair amount of time already on the documentation, reading through the infrastructure, going through the, the, the, uh, uh, CA AML, camel, uh, markup language model, which essentially is part of the way you integrate existing systems. And I want to tell everybody that what's here is, is extremely rare. ","We're not going to get to the details of tooling and design approach. On integrating existing systems,time has been spent on documentation, infrastructure study, CA AML, camel, markup language model study."
"Really build out this very rich, um, experience, uh, very easily. Um, I think the very last thing I'm just going to point out and I think, you know, the time permitted, you probably want to spend a lot deeper dive on here, but, um, you know, the heart of it really it's being able to start to provide very personalized experiences. And so this is a core foundational component that we have this Paul. So what I'm going to do is I'm adding, you know, my profile, um, to, to the canvas, I'm going to click save. And so really what this profile is, is imagine, right? I'd have the ability to, uh, stitch together this knowledge representation of a member based off of all their declared attributes that are being fed from your data fabric, from CRM systems and DM systems, all the observed behaviors around their click string and other work on your member portal, Sydney care, or call it in the call center and all the inferences.  So all of them, the machine learning models, all these outputs, right, are being produced and Anthem, right. To drive this very rich experience. I want to just do is, you know, S the exact same question, one final time with the profile now, right. It's pointing to, and you see, I get immediately, right? The right response. I'm looking to look at ways of how we can get a little bit more proactive or in an advocacy setting. While I may not have been asking about, you know, options that are close by to me, right. It's letting me know that I have other places that I could go to that are in network based off of my profiles, demographic features based off of the provider's demographics off the policies of what I have as in network. Well, all of this is kind of driving, you know, a way of how we're able to do you start to bring together a lot of these assets in this tool, and very simply go through and start to create this rich experience. Um, so let me just show you, I'm just going to show it very quickly. One last piece of the tool, which is all around, um, what does that profile actually like?  Yeah. Um, so this is our, uh, profile visualization tool that this is where you're able to go and start to identify kind of what the schema is, um, that you would like your profile to be. So this is actually an editor as well, so to go into edit, um, and I can start to add, well, how can I do that in this demonstration? And I'm just going to point out a few things, right. Um, as I mentioned, a profile for, you know, what a member could be, that's based off of declared information. So things like their demographics, how long. ","The core foundational component here is being able to start to provide personalized experiences. I add my profile to the canvas, I click on save.

Profile visualization tool, a tool that's an editor as well, where we are able to indentify what the schema is, decide on what would you like your profile to be. The profile of a member could be based off of declared information, how long will the demographics take?"
"Other people can at least use this without having to call you up and say, how do I, you know, I mean, how often. ",Other people can use this without having to call you.
Right that you've already. ,You've already. 
"Right. The way of doing the AI, replace them. ",AI application behavior
For those bigger use cases in a better way. Right? So. ,"Replaces them, for bigger use cases in a better way."
"What's the question, you know, that of course is from who. ",What's the question and from whom?.
"You think it's feasible or Frederick feasible to write like a compatibility routine that, that makes sure that, you know, each of these components that are being separately developed does a, um, impedance check with, uh, with the other components. ","It's not feasible to write like a compatibility routine, to make sure the components are being seperately developed, having the impednace check with other componentsl"
"I'll have some of the highlights it's unfortunately it's not a $0. Um, it's a one year contract. It's separate from, um, an ILS XX contracts as an upfront payment of a million when we execute, which I think hopefully can happen in a week or a couple of weeks. And then we there's some deliverables in December. So proving out the business capabilities that it can handle legacy systems, putting an MVP in place. Once they hit those, we pay them again for a million. So $5 million all in 12 month deal for all the, um, all the cortex horrors that we should need and all that professional services that we should need to build it so that that's, and we're trying to get authorizations so you guys can start work and Mitch can pull people on before we get all the final approvals. So we can through that as well. ","It is a one year contract, separate from an ILS XX contracts as an upfront payment of a million, where execution hopefully can happen in a couple of weeks.

Great. Wow. Great work everybody. Thank you. Okay. Talk with you all again soon. Have a great evening. Bye bye. ,Great work everybody. We will talk again soon. Bye
"And others are creating to really now develop and kind of as the use cases from the future perspective,  That makes sense. ",Others are creating to develop use cases from future perspective.
"I agree with you, unless I'm totally understating out here that a set of use cases. ",I agree with you unless I understand the set of use cases.
"Then we can run this as a very focused program, which does not come as on the critical path of the other two use cases and BI and stars. And that does not put pressure on you. Not that you don't have pressure already and you will not have pressure, but yeah. ","We can run this as a very focused program, which does not come as on the critical path of the other two use cases and BI and stars."
"Hey, John, this is Neil. So help me understand. One thing is, uh, when we define these campaigns and everything, right, uh, to measure a campaign, which is a $2 five out here and everything, uh, is that, uh, from a dollar active, what does it take in a create campaign to make sure that the KPIs and everything and define how do we, is that part of the tutorial and everything in terms of, you know, some cases, the business value or what you're trying to measure at the end of the day after you find your match.

"So, so on the developer portal yeah. Right. For deep. So you said that we can create a separate domain, which could be more, um, ML, uh, yeah. Based right. ","On the developer portal, a separate domain can be created, which could be ML based."
"Some you've been curating with the business. So maybe you can share those around if you have anything handy right now.  Um, um, yeah, there are a few use cases which has come up in the last. ",Those who are curating with the business.Can share those if you have anything handy right now regarding the use cases.
