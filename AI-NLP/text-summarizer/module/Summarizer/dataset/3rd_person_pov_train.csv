you can stop the recording,you can stop the recording
"Dhanuj anything pending from your side? No himanshu no. so whatever you have done you have already shared with me. Yeah I have sent you, if you guys shared me on teams or mail? I shared teams you on teams teams okay yeah fine okay Avinash? Anything pending from your side? not pending from my not pending anything but uh i need to check how much time it takes for different size of video files ","Dhanuj has shared his task on teams to Himanshu, Avinash to check how much time it takes for the different size of video files."
"But, uh, the video,uh which I have uploaded is through postman's. So maybe it took long time. Now we are uploading through the website. Okay. ","The video was uploaded through postman, now it's been uploaded by website."
but anyways uploading is still going right? Anyways it is going from local to server either through website or through so it will take time still,"Anyways the upload is going from local to server, it will still take time the either way."
Oh divesh and hrisheek uh so I guess you guys are done with the upload part and everything and how about the pending task? So I mean which is coffee or something?,Divesh and Hrisheek' updates on coffee part in the upload file dashboard.
"the upload file is almost done. So we are trying to some add some 75 components on the to beautify the upload page, with some gifs and some images. Like, Kajari said we need to add some graphic things on. Um, on the entire pipeline so currently we are doing now",Divesh is trying to add 75 components like gifs and images. Kajari said to add graphic images on the pipeline to beautify the upload page.
But uh uploading through website is taking less time than uploading through postman,Uploading a file through website is taking less time in comparison to postman.
"task is done, right. And it's getting uploaded. And a, as it is uploaded, it is starting the containers. Uh, speech man container. Hmm correct  And Once it is, once everything is done, are you sending any flag back so that the UI knows that everything is done and the buttons should be activated yeah ","Upload through website is taking place and it's starting with speechman containers, once done, are you sending a flag back so that the UI knows everything's done and the button gets activated?"
we need to know through the this thing so the UI that everything is. So maybe in the JSON that you are generating a can have a flag like ready? So if ready flag will be false still last JSON last uh component of JSON is uploaded at otherwise ,"the JSON being generated can we have a flag like""ready"" ?"
Once everything is done then ready  becomes true,"When upload is done, the flag ready becomes true."
Okay So I need to add a key into that JSON ready ,Add a key into the Json called ready.
"Yes at the starting maybe uh if ready is false that means is still it is getting generated if ready is true, that means now all the generation is done and then UI will know that yeah it's done.","In the beginning of JSON add ready as flag, depending on the status, the UI will know whether the upload is done or not done."
"of a scenario where like every minute or every five minutes, a request is sent to, uh, the Mongo DB, API which avinash has created for talking with mongo and it should and we should check that JSON if ready tag ready is false than the button should not be active, if ready is true then button should be active.","Scenario - where for every 5 minutes, a request is sent to Mongo DB API created by Avinash, check the JSON where if ready tag is flase, the button shouldn't be active, if ready tag is true, the button should be active."
So that means you and hrisheek both are doing this task. Right? Yes himanshu yeah so what so then I will work on this logic,Divesh and Hrisheek are working together on same task
avinash by what time uh this is ready? Tag will be done?,By what time will the ready tag be done Avinash?
"Um, then I will create, I will download that JSON and I will check for the false tags","Further, we can download the JSON and look for the false tags."
Let me know okay? So I have a doubt. So if you add a ready tag so you um what what are you doing? You calling API or mongo DB collection right?,"If you're adding a ready tag, are you calling API or mongo DB collection?"
Oh okay so if you call okay so which API you will call? Because thera re 7 or 8 API's,Which API will be called among the 8 API's?
"Sure sure carry on so I will be working on the same labeling of the script which I received so yeah today I'm blocked with that task today yeah um, Himanshu I'm beginning with the second script of a week so I'll be transcribing that today.","Sarika is working on the labeling of the script, she received. Nikita is beginning with transcribing 2nd script of the week."
"Um, uh, I don't think so himanshu so actually that the last time Nikita had given that feedback icon no so that icon I need to add so that icon I can pass to Amit he can just had it","Nikita has given a suggestion on adding a feedback icon to the dashboard, Suresh will be working on the icon and send it to amit."
Wednesday is our demo so today by end of the day.  Most of the things from my side will be complete whatever is pending tomorrow I will integrate,"Our demo is on Wednesday, tasks that are pending from Himanshu's side will be integrated bye EOD."
