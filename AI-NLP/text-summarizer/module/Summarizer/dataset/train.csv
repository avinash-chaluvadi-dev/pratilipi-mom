"Frederick gets my knowledge. I think one of the other important threads here is as we get this to GA coming up with a library of heatmaps or, you know, top, top of the list use cases, or I've had mentioned that, and then you have been mentioning that. So I think having a separate work stream, or maybe there is one already there, but at some point I'd like to understand how does that process yeah. Interesting with this GA. ","With respect to GA, I would like to understand how does having a separate work stream process."
"Now that we now have a platform that we can build off of. Right. So I does that make sense? Right. So I still think that is, uh, Bobby, perhaps this is for you, is that if you looked at that you might be able to hand select some things. ","We have now a platform from which we can build off. If Bobby looked at it, he might hand select some things."
"That kind of stuff. More ads, heavy stuff. Yeah.  Is more like an app developer, which is more around Python and Java and having a solid understanding of objects. ","This work is more around Python, Java and understanding of objects. "
"Actually, I got two offers from Morgan Stanley and Barclays, so I haven't told anyone.",Anuj got two offers from Morgan Stanley and Barclays.
"Perhaps new intents, new models for chatbots, right. That essentially takes the template and instantiate mission right. That you can simulate and launch, you know, which is kind of find it here then step eight, right? This is almost like before you non-commissioned, do you want me to do simulate and launch, right. Which is, again, nothing new. It's a mind that you wanted to test locally before you actually deploy. Um, so that's kind of step eight. And then lastly is, okay, now that I've created a test at the audition, I want to be able to take this mission and the partnership for an Omni channel engagement, right? Whether this is something being exposed to the anthems collaboration services, like project Thai, right. Or any of the chat bot mechanism we want to consider. So that's how we expect these missions to be made available to this ensemble basement. And lastly is why this has being put out. You want to make sure that we are able to measure and. ",Simulating and launching of missions becomes easy because of the mission templates.Next step is to publish these missions for Omni channel engagement.
"Automated the class that routinely are, are handled by project managers and scrum masters in the Lake. And instead let them focus on true  Value added tasks. So. ",Hive will autmate the tasks of project managers and scrum masters making them focus on true value tasks
Of the work OSTP process is to make it so that mere mortals can do this. Okay. So. ,Besides work OSTP process makes it so anybody can do this.
"I think it's a good point. And that's what I was talking about. How do you search what, what is available? What is not? And I think that is something that, you know, John I'll show you  It's deep and everybody that's the marketplace. Right. You know, there should be a marketplace catalog integration.  Yeah. But I think, yeah, I think it would be rather than a marketplace. I think it would be like a portal, uh, a place where in search for these assets and everything to Ashley's point. ","Marketplace their should be a catalog integration is used to serach, what is availabe or not. But rather than a marketplace, it would like portal a place where search for these assets and everything."
"Yep.  Can we talk about the,AI one more time, please. ",Can we talk about the AI one more time.
"Phone number. You never look at it now, right? I've got to, but no one else does, you know, without. ","You never look at your phone number now,Right?."
And frameworks and understanding like that. ,and understanding about frameworks.
"They're already API APIs. So you know, something for which there's an Apogee, a framework that we can drive is to be, maybe we prefer that over some  Thing where it's never been connected. ",They're already API APIs.Something for which apogee and framework is present we can prefer this over somethings which are never connected.
Oh Okay. So that means that makes Anuj as third. But I think Anuj has resigned from the organisation. So I am not sure whether ,Anuj is the third guy. He has resigned from the organisation
"For you and for Sean there then too, to kind of connect a clear on that. Yeah. Yeah. ",You and sean should connect a clear on that.
"And I think one of the one would be, this becomes almost like a sandbox for us to test our code. Actually six features really isn't it. ",This is nearly like a sandbox to test the code.
"I don't know, I could not get a chance to discuss with, but now how to talk to him and then probably, you know, Steve. So I think that's something we haven't, we haven't thought about, you know, how the data will look like yet. So, ",We haven't considered how the data will look like yet.
"To uh, process and do claim edits, I think is probably the most interesting and serious business case we that we have.  Yep. Yep. ",to process and do claim edits is the most interesting and serious business case.
It can be automated and it won't be as gentle. ,Automation wont be gentle.
"No, it's it's it's uh, what, what do you call  Paul in the air? So we breathe AI every day. So,  Um, yeah, I like. ",We breathe AI every day
"So if this term is present, then it is definitely talking about this particular topic. So like that you guys have to start then coming to Bhanu and anuj you guys have to extract those themes. So questions. So I guess I have added in my manual thing, I have added. ","if this term is present, then it is definitely talking about this particular topic."
"Uh, this is a speed that might be bigger conversation or topics than the group here, but as I was going through and just looking at the use cases and the last one I noticed that the member profile was outside of the platform, the cognitive part, I should say the card scale platform from a enterprise. And it goes back to Ted. I think your comment on data structure, right, are we aligning to data structures within the cortex profile of one platform? Are we aligning to data structures outside and then aligning, you know, truly an API data, a data structure within API? Is that part of the, you know, the approach here for some and influencing the development. ",Member profile was outside of the cog scale platform.
Yeah. And I'm hoping some of the company. ,It's good to get some help.
"More intelligent, quick, rapid development. Make. ",Intelligent quick and rapid development.
"Sure. So my name is Frederick Coutts. Um, I am with the, um, with, uh, doc AI and I am helping architect or rather I should say I am architecting and, uh, and needing the technical portions of this particular project. And, uh, in terms of my background, I have a extensive background working with a variety of cloud native groups, uh, and technologies. I was, um, I was involved with Durkee with Docker, right from the start. Uh, I have mid actually before it was publicly released. I was involved with early Kubernetes. Uh, I helped telecoms with their, uh, with their infrastructure and how they, and how they move towards a cloud native and, uh, environments. And that was part of my focus. I was previously on red hat and the office of the CTO, where I ended up, uh, focusing on their, their work strategy. I also am responsible for red hat container storage engine.

It's optional for you. I will just extend to bhanu. ,Optional for you.
"Essentially, maybe you think is that consistent? I've got to figure out what I'm muted here. There we go. Yes. No, I think that's fair. I'd like to, I'd like to pull, um, the I'd like for the work less team and harsher, like others to be in on those conversations so we can pull the right sets of use cases. One, one thing is we don't want to stand in the way, but then to, um, like critique should be there. Others. I want to pull the right ones to all the points that are being made. ",I would like for the work less team and harsher. Critiques should be there.
"Okay, not to get ahead of ourselves. One of the things that as you think about this, it will help everyone is the library of use cases that are being built up by Sourav and other teams, there was a whole punch line and an entire panel effort we can start doing in terms of designing these campaign templates without even touching the product. So that next year, when the time comes, you were to prioritize that, got the SMEs developers together. And then we started launching once the GA yeah, well, the marketplace, right? That's what you're saying is that, that, that starts to get us to that level of, um, call it a democratization of those campaigns to where you need the prohibitive knowledge level of lets me say, yeah, does this make sense to go? Do you're letting kind of data, tell you that and you can go implement it. Yup. That bookend the developer ID, the other bookend is the operational intelligence speeds that you we're talking about what goes in and how you start. ","Saurav and other teams built use cases which is really going to help everyone,without even  touching the product we can start designing the campaign templates.

"Different vendors. Oh, it says I don't have it.  They slide on that, uh, on that specifically. But, um, I I'm, I am putting together the final set of, uh, of comments. Uh, I apologize. There's around three to 400 pages of technical information that I've been, uh, going through over the past several days. So, um, so I need to finalize my, my comments on that. Um, but in general, the, there were some comments around, a lot of the comments were very high level, but, uh, there were definitely comments around the ontologies that I thought were, were fantastic. And there were a large number of, um, of additional, uh, patterns that we may be able to take from a security perspective in terms of how to defend the system and how to protect the data, make sure that we understand where the data's coming from from a Providence perspective, uh, ensuring that it lends it only in the places where it, where it should. And, uh, and I intend to, to pull information from, uh, from each of them in order to, to kind of compare and contrast in terms of our decision.

"Yeah, I was applying for the finance jobs.",Anuj was applying for the finance jobs.
"Good question. Let me play back. What Rajeev, Ted and I spoke one Sunday, long ago, like a month ago. Um, there were three different types of use cases that they were selected. One was a simple hello world, kind of a developer use case. Um, something like an appointment reminder, something that anyone can go in and start getting a feel for the system has no business value, but essentially its users to on it used to certify and train people. That's one second is the business function use case, which is where the low intensity ER, uh, piece was there. And third was a migration use case, which is what Rajiv Paul did the X exoskeleton taking an existing app and migrating over on to work over there. So when we started this and then this Ted has changed to me, those were the three vectors are developer training, use case, a use case for business value. And then I worked for migration of an existing app. That's I think they still as a candidate use cases for work OSTP and the third one, I think in school, except cause, um, if you, if you take the cognitive claims examiner project, for example, and say, how can I, uh, instrument it? So, um, Lorraine can plan emissions. That would be the exoskeleton. ","Rajeev, Ted and I came up with three use cases about a month ago.

"I think an easy way to break it down. And in some of this is, uh, using cognitive scales terms of a, of a skill.

And I just drag and drop that skill into my graph. And now I have something that's that does that for me. And so the both of them are necessary.

"Just kind of set some context of the journey that we've been on with Anthem for really the past year and a half. And if you think about this from this three tier architectural overview from a bottom up perspective, but we have Anthem with data is data fabric from a shook to theme. Um, and with data comes models, right? So these are all the, from the marketplaces that are out of Sean way, working with Steve Aggie, um, and with data and models within Anthem, there's also partners, right? XYZ, AI, cloud Medeco, um, as well as public sources, what we provide is kind of this, uh, intelligence layer that's overlayed on top of the data, which is really enabling you to source the data from a variety of different sources, integrating with existing models and algorithms to then personalize, right, these actionable insights. And we, and we broadcast this throughout a variety of different channels, whether that's the call center or a member portal, um, we're working with, um, Steve Peggy's group on being able to actually hook into this event stream for Sydney care.  Um, but this is all being tracked throughout the member's journey from one of the start with when we know who they are all the way till the end, we're constantly looking at these interactions we're, we're learning. Um, and we're bringing that back to help inform how we can make the system better over time. And just to kind of call out, you know, some of the recent work things that we've been doing specifically with the Neil's organization, working very closely with Roger Pula, you know, in the service experience world. Now we're looking at building out these number profiles, um, and claims profiles, uh, and being able to now deploy it in all States, I'll call it centers, working across all commercial members, really focused on KPIs around things about increase the first call resolution issue, resolution integrated, you know, through, uh, Anthem's developer suite through Apogee, um, and capita streets, um, to be surfaced through other existing tools like parts of the central and doing this, uh, and facing very strict non functional requirements.

"So, so I want to tell you, I'm extraordinarily impressed with what's the what's here now. The next step is how do we take it and make it so that, you know, body with a driver's license can now navigate through the system. And, you know, that's not just give them a triple a map, right.

"Just to respond with. I don't know if Sean Lang still here or not, it looks like it may have dropped, but, um, I wanted to make sure that everything that, uh, uh, teams like his have done, that we can have as a self-service thing so that people can find a way to, uh, be able to package this stuff up and expose it out. And maybe it's cognitive scale behind Apogee, or maybe it's another system behind Apogee for making sure that there's a, there's a path for people to be able to build these things, have them vetted through security and approved and, uh, have the SLA is established and then have them so we can, uh, work out the building for the resource consumption and then have self-service AXA and in the long run. So that way that, uh, it becomes a self managing self servicing system that people can, uh, can expand on over time and build up that ecosystem. So that's sort of what I'm envisioning. ",We need a self managing and self servicing system so that people can build things and deal with security issues and finally have the SLA established.

So maybe if there weren't any other questions on this diagram, I just have one last slide to go over and I was supposed, you know, next steps as to follow up items that I thought were pretty important, um, to kind of help with long for the week.

Um, I don't think all of you have the invitation for that. Certainly. Uh, some of you do and you're welcome to forward it to each other, but if you, uh, you know, if you think you need to be there and, uh, some of the dialogue you heard  and  here today, we'll bring some of the learnings and, and then Nathan will be there to kind of share some of the pains.

"Compatibility between the two and try on both of these, but, but we'll have that discussion. I just wanted, I was curious on that. Thanks.  Yeah. And to be clear, one of the things that I'm trying to do in the architecture is set it up so that we can be agnostic to versions two to the versions that are running as well. So if we have a V five and a D six together, ideally they should not compete with each other in terms of, in terms of how they integrate, uh, although the devil's in the details. So we'll have to make sure that we, that we take that head on, um, a couple other things as well is we need, we also will need people to, so the cognitive scale has a training set, a thing called cognitive view. And so we, we, we will need a list of people who need access to that training sessions, uh, as soon as possible. And so if you can get, uh, to me and Bobby, the, uh, list of people who you all believe should have at that training, please send, please send us the, uh, the emails and we will make sure that they get that they get out of them.

"And it's an ACS can help simplify this as well, because we can use the identities there. So when you connect into a Apogee or some other similar, uh, so some than, uh, w well, we should be able to make use of that so that you don't have to share a secret and, uh, have the developer type in passwords or, or tokens instead when they run it, it runs in that development environment. With the development, token only gets development as data. When it ships into a production environment, that's much more controlled with, and those things just automatically shifted to the right side of identities that determined what type of things it gets. Uh, and also from the, uh, what type of resources, the volume that they can get access to. Like, you probably don't want to send me, Hey, you have unlimited calls at all hours of the day and night. You may want to say these are the, uh, the limits and make sure that they all get applied as well. And so, and those can be controlled by, by roles and tracked by.

"No, I think, I think this is, this is great.Laksh um, basically completes the journey end to end and very well laid out. Um, the question that I have is that, uh, from a developer community perspective, right? When there's an interface to the trusted data model in bots and in their interpretation of what exactly they're going to be doing, right. Um, there's a reason why I'm coming there, right? So, uh, how do I match my reason to what I should be looking for? Right. So I'm trying to solve, I've been told that you need to develop this XYZ and by the subject matter expert, and they are trying to tell me exactly what I need to do. How do I need to, how do I look at the repository of trusted bots or models and everything? How do you bridge that gap? Because there's, there's going to be so much that we develop over a period of time and everything.I think the developer portal and everything that we talked about, how do we connect?

"Yeah. Sounds good. So, so really well has I think, I mean, this is again, been iterated over, um, around one of the three cases that we've been talking about. So there's the basic developer or training use case, um, where we want to really start to enable these individuals on. That would be part of more on the X, Y side to start to build out these fairly complex applications in a simple way. Um, the analogy that we've been using this as similar to what was done and, you know, the older days on the internet with the pet store app, like this would be a simple equivalent of a pet store app, uh, just to kind of certify those excellent developers. Um, just let me skip over there one really quick just to get onto that other, the third use case, just to talk about that a little bit more, but this is let's take an existing, you know, application, um, or something that has been worked on and be able to prove out that that level of migration and the previous integrations and the portability of how we're able to leverage kind of legacy systems and have that work, um, with workOS.  And so this has all been around some existing use cases I think are settled on potentially claim rejection. Um, and then finally, you know, the, our use case, which is the one that we've been, we've been working with, uh, Sean Lingus group and specifically with, um, Steve Aggie from a data engineering perspective, as well as Jim Perry and perspective on how do we operationalize some of the models that have been, um, and the prediction marketplace, this low intensity, ER, model it to start, um, and be able to start to identify really what are these cognitive we're calling cognitive intervention, or be able to target these individuals I'd have a high propensity of committing this low intensity or utilization and intervene provide other options. That's an essence. And I think the thing that's really important though about were our initial discussions, proven that out, isn't just necessarily identifying the People, but also being able to measure, right, the outcomes understand  what are the right interventions that are working are the right individuals at the time through the right channel, um, as well as be able to learn.  So to understand how do we bring these, these interactions, these data points to help the data scientists, um, look at notes, look at that. How is it affecting the models and how they, these models could be trained or retrained by better outcomes? And then the fifth point, which we were also gone around later was all around. Correct. So how do you identify potential bias that might be accidentally introduced, um, or fairness issues or robust decisions? Um, all of that is really credibly important whenever you're looking at really productionized stuff. So that's at a very high level of what we're doing with LIER. I think, you know, what we want to do now really determined what the, what the scope is, knowing that we want to build this, you know, through this work on less initiatives and how do we enable again, people that have potentially a low amount of experience to then go off and build this LIER solution. And I think that that's what we're, we're kind of heading now on making sure. So when we're building Skywalker release, as far as rent, you know, that's, that's the, the goal, the goal is to really enable those people to fill it. ",Basic developer or training use case would be a part of more on the X-Wing side to build fairly complex applications.Third use case which is claims rejection use case is all about migrating applications from production to workOS by leveraging legacy systems.And in Low Intensity ER use case cognitive scale helps in operationalizing the models and most importantly scope is to be determined.

Um, all throughout the stack of experience. Um, I did have a few other things I wanted to do. ","It's made of observed behaviors.

"Yeah. So I think you're talking about two things, right? That I don't disagree with you that if we take a bigger bite than we can chew, then we don't chew. Right. So I would say that, uh, what our MVP is in our hands, but what the product looks like at the end is a broader definition.

But at the same time, I just want to make sure that we all agree that this is beyond the AI This is a lot of other things that are going to go back. So I'm totally fine with that. I just don't know  It's going to enable so many good things. Okay.  Exactly. Exactly.

"There's going to be kinda this slide where Ted asked me to focus a little bit more on the tooling aspect of what we have in, um, cortex, um, looking more at, you know, studio and how we're able to start to integrate and orchestrate these, these models, algorithms RPA box.

But, uh, ",In next meeting we bring other diagram which will have cortex as a part of areas or single.
"That's just creativity. So yeah. Showed me, I think two minutes here. Right? So guys, I think this is, you know, when we looked at the last week, you know, that that's tax light energy on review to do it. What we're envisioning here is, you know, think of this as a pipeline or an assembly line of hollered developer journey will look like right from beginning to end. And we kind of discern in 10 steps and it could be more, it could be less, but this is kind of how we think of taking a developer through a series of steps here towards the development and implementation of the AI mission or the campaign. Right? So if we start at the very top here, the very first, like we talked about, right, because the developer portal being the one stop shop for developer community, right? We have to leverage, uh, you know, either an existing set of API data sets from Anthem data fabric or perhaps models for marketplace.  You think of this as one starting point for all of these assets to come in. And then as you're taking this into the next step, which is, you know, we expect as these data sets and models are brought to bear, that has to be a trust angle towards it so that we can stand using a set of quality metrics. And this is where we have certified, which is one of our offerings within cortex that allows you to create basically these trusted indexes on top of data sets and models. And once you get past step number two, right now we can English and that getting published into an air marketplace, right? They think of this first, these centers are most like an acid, right? The only thing is, are they extending this on, they're publishing this for a broader consumption. Uh, and this could be, this is all going to be packaged as in a cortex components, rather than these are skills, datasets models, et cetera.  Right? So do you think of these as a nice little package container artifacts, that's going to be made available with some manifests that you can search browse and you're subscribed to it. And then you also have to have a capability to add, not just anthems data sets, but also have other partners and ISP data sets this, our community resource, you know, allergy forecasts the capacities, et cetera, et cetera. That's what we want to be able to have the market piece, being a market place for what private assets or publicly available data is at the models. Uh, so that we can start consuming that into the next steps, which is really starting to think of these as ingredients right now, these are brilliant snare. We expect a developer to start going into this ID, right? And that's why you see the arc, right? This is, is in the context of an , which I think is going to be a combination of cortex ads and the object model that we talked about here, right?  So using this as the platform or the IB, you know, a developer convenience change sheet, or create, you know, a goal oriented in a campaign, but the campaign itself, and maybe at a higher level, this is not a fraud detection in any one of those top things that we want to measure goals and needs. But then when you drill down into that one going into step six, this is where you start defining, set up missions. You know, again, keeping in line with the military terminology, a campaign could be a larger campaign, right? Which could be several years, several months long, but because visions are short term, you know, that are geared towards the attainment of a campaign goal and to be a illusion, right? That as we progress, as we mature, we can think of missions being made available for the proper assess templates so that they don't need to start from the scotch. Right. For example, if I were to search for a mission around handling type two diabetes risks and interventions, perhaps there is a catalog of these templates that wanted sub-site to and selected an instruction sheet. If the most like starting the word template, instantiate a word document. Once you have that, you know, this is going to expect the local developer to start configuring, you know, this mission right around whether it's more parameters. ","Developer journey kind of discern in 10 steps.First step is developer community where we leverage API,data sets,models. Next step is to bring data sets and models to certifying next step is to containerize as a cortex components and also these containers can hold private data as well as anthem data.Next step is defining missions and as we progress these missions are made available just like templates within cortex.And final step is mission simulation and launch."

"Proficient, uh, we're also gonna in future sessions talk about the new design system that we're creating called jive. Uh, that really informs, uh, behavioral economics of our apps ought to be developed human centered design constructs around, um, how apps and, you know, need to really serve the, uh, the human needs. And then the really clean new user experience that brings all of the Anthem, uh, digital assets into a more unified design system. And then lastly hive, which is the reason for the recording is we want to start recording all of our virtual interactions where so much knowledge is shared and actually transcribe those and organize that content into.

And, and obviously, you know, there'll be, there'll be many challenges, both on the connection front and on the, uh, AI, uh, front. But, but that I believe is the big payoff, right.

"I think, I know this is probably a good example of what you're looking for. Right. So, you know, think of campaign. I think, you know what we decided to say, here's a template, what go into a campaign and, uh, you know, for example, the campaign would start with a simple, better on the restriction. What have you, but then, you know, there is a, there's a goal that we need to capture. So this example I'll say increase by 10% from members, right? So that's kind of the list of goal that you want to add in. And then when you start adding, you know, are going through a series of speeds or series of tutorials, you will see that that campaign is comprised of multiple missions. Um, so in our world, cortex mission is a most like an agent. That's what we have today in cortex. There's no sort of an agent like that, uh, that would essentially manifest into the regions. So we anticipate that a number of missions will be used for a particular goal. Um, then we have a standard pattern for defining these agents, right? So we have four kind of patterns. Uh, you know, one is cause a sourcing agent, uh, you know, which is all about how do we collect the necessary information from pages. ","Campaign start with simple ,better on the restriction. This example can increase by 10% from members.

"In the actual transcripts, there can be more questions. So don't only depend on what my, uh, manual transcript is saying. You also look at the actual transcript and see questions. Are there or not actions, discussions, obviously that is there. What is, what are the action items? What are the discussion item, questions, dates. So if there is a deadline that has to be, something has to be done before a deadline. So that can be one intent with the name deadline. So if there is an intent with the name deadline, then the deadline, which is the actual date that needs to be extracted as well, because later once you will click on the intent of deadline, then that sentence will come in the right-hand side. And then it will tell us  What is the actual date that will be extracted. so like that, if you look at the presentation which kajari has created, on the left hand side, we have all the intents.

"Where Ray is, um, 2050, two days from now and, uh, GA for that as a year. So to me, the question, right, we now know what the answer is. The question is that I want to, in the beginning, the answer today is what is the right use case that meets these dates, right? Because if we pick the wrong one, we're going to blow it, right? We're trying, if we're, if we're constraining the problem to be on a tight deadline, to be very focused, to bring what resources we can, the knowledge we can learn and whatnot. But if we pick the wrong problem, we're going to be, you know, way off. Right. And people do live in a fantasy and maybe living in a fantasy world, no matter what, but, but with the right, my hypothesis is, is that with the right? If we slept the right criteria and the right date, then we can achieve this. And so what is it. ",What is the right use case that meets this dates?.
"Yeah. So, so can you make a quick statement, your luxury? So I think one that is completely what is definitely an ideal flow Porsche. Um, we, we definitely have to draw this. I'm almost thinking like a snowman diagram going through the, each of the components, but I'm almost thinking that, you know, for a simple, hello word developer, we probably are most happy to make it in. I'm using the Martha Stewart analogy. You're right. Some of those piece parts are already baked into it. The developer is going to use basically, for example, a catalog or a marketplace to search for an existing API and wiped away. Right. So you'd say it's a very controlled example for a hello word, wherever you zoom back out, you will basically have a flow saying this is the small example, but think of this in the context of a larger application. Right? So that's one way of thinking through how we want to scale this. ","Snowman diagram going through each of the components.A simple hello world developer are most happy ot make it.

"Uh, if I, uh, um, uh, Fredrick, you know, before you go here, right? So how should I know, I think that's, that's a good question. You know, what I'll do is probably next week, I'll try to bring the, bring out, uh, um, holistic diagram of how these things happen. The way doc, you look at it, right? You asked the right question. Others two parts. Yes. There are 2% that's right. So one person is, is the, um, is the, to me, you know, who is actually trying to create, uh, uh, the campaign, right? So once, once you request a campaign and once you start creating the campaign, there are multiple pieces that needs to be put together, right? One is the, um, the, the orange box out there on the cortex side, where you need to have all these, um, you know, clustered data and the insights and all those, uh, companies that we need to build at the same time, they are also dependent on, on, on the plumbing pieces, right?  The API has the fleet to get from, and the learning model that we need to take from, you know, Steve's team and the APS and all that. So I guess the, the way that we look at it and try to, you know, keep me honest here, right? So, so areas and some automation plays where all these pieces will be automated on the developer. The diff the other persona, a developer will be able to start, okay. You know, here are my multiple components that I might need, or here are the plant plumbing competence that I need to get the guest member data API or from, from cortex. Right? So once there is one that is, you know, that's the local thing that we are talking about, right. Needing those components together, and that's available for the developer. And then, you know, they can build on top of, so th th that does give it a high level of what we're looking at. I mean, these two are different pieces, but I think once the, once the company is requested in one spot, identify what are needed. The developer will have the, uh, should have the capability on the developers here to knit together and say, Hey, I need these APIs. And these templates are in rebuilding to my, my overall big picture. It doesn't make sense. ","I'll try to bring out holistic diagram of how these things happen ,once you request and start creating the campaign, there are multiple pieces that needs to be put together.

I think we need to make sure that we, as a broader definition around it and the use case mix right now is very heavy on AI, which is fine. I think we can book two or three use cases which are around AI. I focused on cortex as a, as a core engine, but also we need to make sure that we are leaving space for some other use cases, which will be good to have in the repository and make sure that we can execute on those because a large population of developers right now is not using the AI tools. And we need to make sure that we are the bridging the gap for them also while providing workOS as a platform to speed up development and everything. So I think we need to broaden this. I know you've mentioned at the beginning. So as predicted and team work together on this one, I just want to make sure that we can, we can. ","I think use case mix right now is very heavy on AI,focused on cortex as a core engine and we have to ensure that we are leaving space for some other use cases because huge populace of designers presently isn't utilizing the AI tools.We need to bridge the gap for them by providing WorkOS as a platform."

"Uh, I would imagine that people aren't really productive until, uh, as an engineer at Anthem, uh, without, you know, many months of training, is it fun to do three months? You know, of course it depends upon where they were before, but since the goal really is to be able to pull people in in two weeks time, really, and such, now we're talking something where we can actually have gig workers come in.  And so now we're approaching this as a API, as an operating system that we can train people up. We can essentially give them a set of classes, online videos and such, and they don't have to ask too many people's questions about what they're trying to get done, right. That we are trying to distill it down into a very sharp, very small surface area of new thing of individual projects to learn. So if you imagine, what does it mean to train a hundred thousand people to be functional in the Anthem to government process? It means that we have to have fixed interfaces, fix gooeys videos, help sessions, and so on. And so now it really becomes something like what it means today to program for AWS or, um, uh, or, or MCO is Stan or, or anything, or, or Android systems where you are trained in this environment.  And then the specifics of the task and the job you're going to do is going to be, um, uh, you know, specific to given systems and section. So, so that means stepping up the normalization of what doing to a much higher level. And that is more like essentially what, what we developed an Apple in creating an operating system. And that's another reason why we call it in a West, right? It's not, not just simply a set of platforms and such, but it is a set of tools. So I wanted to, there's a lot of detail behind each of these boxes and I'll get to that in a minute, but I wanted to essentially say that top there in the green world are all of our current interaction systems, right? It's Sydney, there's PCMs, uh, there's the claim systems. There's a huge amount of surface area there. ","The goal is to pull and train people in two weeks.

" And underneath that is, this process is this middle layer here of IDE frameworks, interactive environment and frameworks for programming that there's some dev op process. There's an execution platform that is going to perform and run these applications. And then you can see below that, or our good friends from cognitive scale and their hard work and creating cortex studio and cortex fabric. And so these systems are essentially one of the most important new ingredients as part of what we're talking about here. And the idea here is that we're building on the frameworks to enable, uh, this, this is essentially serving as this amazing springboard to pull together a lot of different ideas and tools and utility to make something happen. And we're also depending upon them with their ability to create the training videos and training and, and such. So there's a lot of good things in our partnership with cognitive skills underneath that is, um, uh, uh, this other new layer on that we're getting from, uh, doc AI called ACS sometimes in Cornell.  And that builds on, on red hat Coobernetti's and cloud based infrastructures that we are, um, uh, putting in place. So, um, we'll talk more in detail about that as well. And then that, of course is the Anthem data Lake now, um, you know, many pieces of information are missing from this environment. And that's because I really tried to simplify this down to the, you know, the, uh, uh, uh, you know, Gale level, uh, essentially of what we're doing. So all of the infrastructure of the Anthem, uh, developer, uh, platform, um, all of that, that work that feeds into this in systems, and that's critically important to make this happen in greater level of detail. Right. Um, what we're talking about here is, um, you know, a buzzword soup almost of, you know, having these development kit. Um, I like the star Wars theme a lot.  I quote, you know, so I'd love for the IDE to, for example, to be called the X, Y was essentially wants something that feels like you are in command of this amazingly light, uh, fighter. That's very agile, that's able to, uh, take and, and a developer feels very empowered by it. And so what we'll talk about what that means in detail about the interaction. Um, but you'll see here that we have, of course, the, uh, just the numerous frameworks and componentry that we have available to us in develop a kit. Then on the right-hand side, we have which API APIs and developer platforms then, you know, the next level down is you'll see, there is the cortex studio and the fabric to the left-hand side of the screen. Uh, there is this idea of having a marketplace components that people third-party people can develop for us.  And we can incorporate in, um, on the top of there is, you know, visualizations reporting systems and UI layers that you spoke about on the right hand side is this is a rich set of additional storage systems that are added on top of existing Anthem data Lake and fire storage. And one of the things of course we want to take advantage of are important new initiatives, such as snowflake. So sorry about this slide, it's kind of confusing and a lot of details associated with it, but I wanted to make sure, you know, people feel somewhat oriented that this is, you know, what we're building here is not an entirely new world is a world that needs to fit into and on top of the Anthem infrastructure, but brings in place a lot of machine learning in artificial intelligence, uh, uh, structures in place.  Um, I think a  Very core part of what we're talking about here is to extend today's Anthem developer platform. ",Creation of Cortex studio and cortex fabric which provides interactive environments and framework for programming. Cognitive scale will train and provide training videos. 
Eventually we won't need any more that.,We don't need much.
"Cool. So at 3.30 I am meeting with Shilpa and Shravanti. So, at the same time you can also join",Avijit can join the 3.30 meeting with Shilpa and Shravanti
"Yeah. I think the reason why I was asking lectures that if in case we are building a new use case tomorrow, whether it's around their sexual orientation or different, uh, I would have picked that to be developed under workforce. So that's what my question was that, Hey, will it, will it have a transferability out there or not? We can take that discussion offline. I think that's different. I think we need to make sure that the compatibility between the two and what difference does it make? We need to be cognizant of that. So we may want to have five and six out there so that. ","If a new use case is built, whether around their sexual orientation or other, that should be developed under workforce. we need to be aware of compatibility between the two and know the difference it makes."
"Since, thanks, Neil. Thanks for the, but the, I think the confusion part that I'm having is on the orange box. Right? I get the developer portal box of, you know, you have an API, you're going to create a restful API. As you have the data, you get it, you pick the API connection out, but the code is, for example, if get weather function is not available, where do you go create those, those, is it part of the ads or is it part of the cortex that you've got? You could go. ","The confusion part I am having is orange box.I get the developer portal box you are going to create a restful API.You have the data get it and pick API connection out. If function is not available,where do you create those and it is  part of the ads or cortex?"

"Yep. Manoj. Uh, so I think, I think harsher to answer your question, I think it could be two P two personnel also, or it could be, uh, uh, API developer, um, working with, uh, us, me, uh, creating a campaign, which they are working on. Um, and that's the ease of use and, and, uh, adoption that we want to drive out there. Right. Uh, low code adoption of, of AI within the enterprise and everything. Right. But, but to your point, it, it is possible that hopefully we will have most APS available already for enterprise usage perspective, but it is possible that there are two different developers, one making the API available, the other consuming, and as part of the cortex, uh, you know, as an AI developer  Construct out there. Uh, so I would say  That it could be both, it could be one developer also, or it could be two different people engaging to achieve the same campaign result. Yeah. ","It could be an API developer am working with creating campaign  and low code adoption of AI within enterprise and everything.but it is possible that there are two different developers, one making the API available, the other consuming, and as part of the cortex, an AI developer Construct out there.

"Right. So, so this is just showing, you know,  We support multiple ways of being able to stream data. It's not just text, but it's binary as well. Audio is one of them. Um, but the other is right, because now that we add document classification as a skill, right, we can upload the image directly on the claim that I'm really asking question about. And based off of the results that it's coming back with, you know, we're getting much better on being able to start to extract out the entities and relate back to the answer that I want. So the point here, right, is that, you know, in three really easy steps, we started off with the saying, you know, what claim are you referring to? So that really get into an answer for that one. And the thing that I just want to point out is these skills, these atomic functions, these algorithms, right? These aren't rappers to your existing models, your 500, 600 models that are in your prediction marketplace are easily accessible as a skill, all of the data, right. That's being produced.

"Um, especially where things are at right now, we're really trying to get things going, um, on this user experience. Um, I think having a better understanding on ads and the upper bottle store, um, ACS as all the things that we talked about, right? All of this will help inform kind of hers to have that conceptual component diagram, um, which we want to be able to iterate on and kind of come back with a much more robust view for next week. Um, being able to help at least sign off on what we are, what we're all aiming towards for this, um, overall developer training, the scope as a tail. And then, um, as, as Frederick mentioned, I think earlier, you know, we're in the process right now, uh, um, working with the Anthem AI dev ops team on their sandbox environment. So keeping that work going, so then we can use that, um, you know, or. ","We have a better understanding on ads and upper bottle of store.All of this will help inform users to havea conceptual component diagram. Earlier we are in the process right now, working with Anthem AI devops team and their sandbox environment keep the work going, we can use that."
"How does all that work. Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. So, so, you know, when you're, when you're creating that campaign, right, that should be tied to some business objective or business outcome, which will then be tied back to our, we're able to measure those outcomes uniformly. Now this is all going to be brought into again, what is that real experience gonna look like? Um, as we, as we do this with Argo, and one other thing, I think that why it's incredibly important that we establish, you know, the developer panel route is that while we're working through this, Nope, these are the people that are really going to be using these IDs. So it's imperative. ","When we create a campaign wwe should tied to some business objective or outcome,which will be tied back to us and able to measure those outcomes uniformly."

"Yeah. So, uh, that, that, that, you know, uh, just in terms of agenda real quick, and then we'll pop you Bobby, uh, essentially what's happened last time, talking about this topic on, then focusing in, on some of the technologies. Um, we had Frederick begin talking last on some of the deeps issues and such, and then John, um, and Sean Connealy is on if you made it. We'd love to hear a little bit by January 19. Yes. And then talk about project structure, component owners, and so on that we need to address. Um, but, but you know, there's a lot of this there's so much here. Right. And I feel like, um, uh, we must, if we're going to hit the state, we must have a deadline that we have our use case. And so I think that, that, you know, I'm gonna, uh, I'm going to put, put arbitrarily down this time next week. We, we, we, we pick a use case, right? We can't, we can't go, we can't go very far in this, in the cycle without that. Yeah. ","We'd love to hear an update by january 19.If we are going to hit a state, we need a deadline for our use case arbitarily iam picking up this time is next week."

"You're right. And I think, and I think we should just make sure that that becomes part of the overall process that we fall out here, because that way we already have looked through the Kings. We exactly know what we need to do, and basically make that as the part, which is, which is running and training our new associates. ",Running and training new associates becomes part of the overall process.
"I, uh, buy identities that are, that are cryptographically tied to that. So hopefully we can make some of that easier.  I agree. And I think, I think in the, in the area's construct and everything, do we put a big, big box around it, which is basically inclusive of both that makes it easier from a control perspective. I think we should look at that option also because if we want to make sure that there's, there's a, there's a control aspect in terms of how a developer comes across different platforms and everything, how they have access and everything. That's something that probably we should look at, but anyway, ","Hopefully it make some of that easier in the area's construct and everything.We put a big box around it, which makes it easier from a control perspective. We make sure that a control aspect in terms how a developer comes across different platforms and everything."
"I think there's one other things see on just kind of help enhance the experience and the development. Um, and that's nearly kind of where we're, we're kind of taking a shift and how we're looking at this, and that's being a lot more bold driven where you can look at things on how you could construct a mission, um, around things like intends to the ER, um, and look at ways of saying, well, my goal could be, I want to keep Suzanne Miller out of the ER, or I want to keep these individuals, you know, out of the ER, in a much more higher level. Now I'm not saying that we've thought through all the intricacies of that. Um, but you know, that's where the work is really gone over partner or go on what is that experience? And then from there, can we simplify the overall like development life cycle, uh, to solve for something like the year or at least to be able to be able to operationalize and measure the impact and then be able to help, uh, capture the words, not necessarily help with the model of development. Um, I'm happy to walk through with you.  Yes.  All right. So let's, so maybe we can go to the next slide because I think what we're, what we're showing here is at least a very basic level of our vision of power, you know, looking at constructing these, this, you know, hello world, uh, training portal. And I think, you know, a really good analogy that we can, we get, you know, very basic to what your calming universities are. Um, you know, across the States where let's say we have university of Texas, the equivalent, um, you know, really work on less. I do. How do you enable your students to be part of this work university or work in is kind of a school within the university itself, um, which is all around kind of, you know, skydiver, which is cortex V6 in this case. And we're kind of carving out that discipline and, um, you know, taking a point of view on how we can enable, you know, developers, you know, as that school. Um, so, you know, based off of what we outlined really around this hello world, um, we're starting to separate it out and I'm just curious florals, um, where developers will be this kind of a self-serve based. Um, but it all really stems from, you know, how are we able to start to create these campaigns, which as I mentioned, this is goal driven, um, approach. Um, and in the simplest terms, you can think of doing this from a. ","I think see on just kind of help enhance the experience and the development we're kind of taking a shift and how we're looking at this and that's being a lot more bold driven where you can look at things on how you could construct a mission can we simplify the overall like development life cycle with the model of development. we starting to seperate out hello world programers and good programers ,then we starta campaign as i mentioned in the goal driven."
"Data and the model and the API level number five had Because typically in our experience, ","Number is more focused on the data,model and API."

"Yeah. So, so the X, the X wing developer is the one that, or the group of people that would be developed in these fairly complex applications on work LS. Um, which I think. ",X wing developer is one or a group of people that would be developed in the applications on workOS.
"Join an appointment, or being able to provide a reminder to an appointment, nothing super complex about it. Uh, but at least provide some, you know, very intuitive ways of how we're able to integrate across know the systems that are making God. Uh, excellent. Um, so the tutorials are broken up from crank campaigns being able to add missions or think of these as, um, you know, very atomic functions or we call them or text agents or templates, right. That are there to execute on top of that campaign. Uh, tutorial three is all around how you're able to test, right how well your, your campaign was constructed. Um, whether through things more traditional software engineers are familiar with UAT, but also you think of being able to run this through like simulations being in the role in tutorial course, how you're able to launch a campaign, which is really getting the deployment aspect. And then finally with, uh, the fifth tutorial and the finalist, how you're able to start to measure, measure your outcomes. So we're seeing this as kind of, you know, five very discrete steps, um, to kind of give you a full end to end view of kind of all the capabilities that are being brought into the Skywalker release for the summer.  And this is part of, um, what you're seeing here as Brandon of our own, um, cognitive university, which as I mentioned, where we can do is we can take part of that and we can have that fit into a broader workout West university, which is there to evolve, you know, the masses across a bunch of different personas, um, and any questions on, on, um, the training. ","Join an appointment, or being able to provide a reminder to an appointment is not that complex but at least provide intuitive ways of how we’re able to integrate well known systems that are making good. tutorials are broken up from crank campaigns being able to add missions. That are there to execute on top of that campaign.tutorial three is all around how you're able to test how well your campaign was constructed. And then finally the fifth tutorial is how you're able to start to measure your outcomes."
"Uh, that meant I just stopped. Got it. Got it.  Yeah. And to be clear that this was framed, I should have written this down on the top. This was framed with a, with a milestone, one being the 42 days, uh, with, with some ideas to, to put on there, but there's certainly overarching. There's definitely a overarching goals that do we need to make sure get incorporated into the, into the grand mission. And, uh, I can also work on a set of, of, uh, slides and so on that we can collaborate on to help cover the, the larger set of goals that we can use as a, as a shared, uh, as, as, as a shared plan is like, where, where do we want to go? W what do we want to do? So we're all on the same, on the same page. And we believe we have an understanding as to what is we're trying to do. Uh, but I, I specifically try to focus this one specifically on, on milestone milestone one, and I completely agree with the API integration part. That's, that's something that we can not overlook as well is how do we actually integrate this into the, into the broader system? So thank you for pointing that out as well.  Okay.

"The victory equally.  Perfect. That's the one thing missing is the main team. So we'll, we'll get that into the doc and that. Okay. Um, so let's get, we'll give you a, just a few quick updates on where we've, how we've come from. We're going to go through, so Frederick, I'm going to turn to you first to go through the hello world scenarios that we're in process of setting up. So just to be clear for the group, the hello world is, uh, when the simplest approach is to just, just make sure the stack works. This isn't going to be, um, incredibly deep. This is just making sure the stack works and connects to each other. Um, and then Frederick is going to talk about some of the feedback we've gotten from crowdsourced vendors that are provided, have given us at least several hundred pages of documents on feedback for work OSTP and the components. Uh, and then after that, uh, pull it back to me. And then John, I'm going to turn it over to you to go into cortex and some of the, some of the deeper items that we've got and what the actual work that's happened. I want to make sure we save time. So I'm gonna manage time here pretty closely. We must get two use cases today. We've got, Keneally joining in five minutes, so he'll wait around for us, but this is the brunt of our discussion, um, to, to get into today.  Is that fair? Okay. Thank you.

"thing is Amit and dhanuj. So text summarization, so you will be finding the actual transcript and you will be having the mom. So you will have to see what are the exact, uh, sentences in the generated transcript, which matches with the mom. And then based on that, you will have to summarize. So obviously the summarization will be the normal process which you have been doing using Pegasus or t five, after that you will have to see after the summarization, what are those important things and what are not? So you continue with the text summarization, and then after that you will be, uh, giving this summary to, uh, I guess, uh, ","Text summarization will be the normal process using Pegasus or t five, after that important things need to be identified."
"But can help you with that. That makes sense. So Bobby, a couple things on the sow.

We're locking in the resources that are going to be part of this, this, uh, ongoing work. And then the acceptance criteria for the release has got to be super clear. Uh, so that, um, we're all, we all know what good means and it's, it can be a, you know, a gray area it's pretty black and white. Um, and no, no excuses for, uh, coming back into summer and saying, we did this, meet this because Anthem didn't do this. Or Cox, Gail didn't do this. Everyone's equally accountable to the outcome.

"Yeah. So like setting to that point, even if it's, you know, so I think the civic, um, example in a controlled environment, you know, I think I have full confidence that we'll do that. Right. So, cause you're almost wiring it, the success I'll be useful too, is to augment that by stubbing out a couple of personas. Right. So one would be, you know, a developer that's basically is writing whole world too. So he's going to go to the marketplace or the dev portal or the API portal to reuse. Yep. Yep. Other interesting thing would be to look at it from a perspective of an operator console and saying, you know, Howard, someone that's managing deployments and operations.  Yeah. Yeah. That goes in line very closely with, uh, with what. ","I have full confidencethat we will do that, you are almost writing it, the successuseful too is to augmented that by stubbing out of a couple of personas.

"The first, uh, for the first release for December and, and. ",First release will be in December
"That's fair. Um, so I think, I mean, I can, let me kind of walk you through, walk you through this flow and we can rip this apart. Completely.  Screw it back on was slow. Can we just go to the, yeah, yeah. So, so let's, let's just kinda start with, you know, the, the overall flow of how we're seeing this unfold. And let's start with, you know, the ads group, um, where, you know, the developer portal as a, as a developer, right. I want to be able to create an API. Um, that's going to be able to get member data in real time. And so now there's development that happens that gets pushed up to some repository like GitHub that might be hooked up into some, um, build server like bamboo. And what that can then do is provide, you know, a snapshot of that, that version of what that concrete implementation is of this API. That's being exposed, maybe through something like Apogee, um, where we now have a get member API, super, super simple, simple flow.  I know I'm going through a lot of the details here. Um, but imagine right, what the purpose of this API is, is based off of, you know, some, let's say a member ID, what his responsibility is for his, um, for turned back, you know, that member option. And this is where I started to slip in some of the things around the object model store. Um, but my sense is, again, from what we've been, how things have been unfolding is that here you have this catalog of data objects, and one of those would be a member and where that's version it's defined, it has metadata around it. And what we can do through this facade is be able to at least point to potentially get in real data, like from a production database, either getting de-identified data, um, or even synthetic data. Right. Um, so, so the purpose of kind of decoupling even, and, you know, what's happening from the, the API to the object store layer, um, which again, we might wanna, you might want to talk through, um, but very similar life cycle from an object of select, from any type of code where you would have a developer that would go in and update that object accordingly, it would be version appropriately through some get up and that level of automation like Bamberg.  Um, so that's kind of, you know, at the top level from a very simple component view of eight, uh, ads to being able to pull data in real time from some series of databases or data lakes, um, the bottom piece, right, that's highlighted in orange here is a little bit more of the details around what is it that, you know, a developer to be doing as well, um, by creating this appointment reminder, hello, this is the steps that would be outlined in the tutorial. Um, if you kind of go from left to right, what you see is you start with, uh, campaign. And as we mentioned in the slide before, you know, what is the goal of that campaign, maybe to increase engagement by X percent. And then what we can do is we can add these processes in the workflow to be able to build out, you know, how we can get trusted data, which can be exposed from, you know, getting that through ads by invoking this API that has a link now to the object model, um, and also enrich that data with other API APIs that aren't necessarily part of Anthem, but are external factors.  So example, let's say for this appointment reminder, maybe we want to be able to provide very personalized reminders based off of weather. So, Hey, don't forget your umbrella or your appointment at 3:00 PM. It's about, you know, there's 60% chance of running something as simple as that. So what we're doing is we're kind of constructing this, this, you know, data object on the fly for this member and we're generating on the next piece, you know, these cognitive insights, um, in this case it would be a notification and that notification then can then be gone to send the notification, um, which should be broad castable and omni-channel way. Um, now what I posted in this kind of middle thing as kind of hanging out by it, Anthony systems, isn't this hello world web portal. And what I'm thinking was just, I don't know if this could live in ads, the web map, um, or if it could even just be as, as simple, you know, just think of a simple UI, are you logged in with your member ID, it generates this notification that your program, um, this, this AI campaign, um, and what that enables you to do is render the notification and then just simply be able to provide people.  Did you, did you agree with that or disagree? Um, and which that case can then be called out, uh, to back to the feedback and measurements component, where we can collect feedback and measure the outcomes. Now, a really simple it's full flow I'm envisioning, right? If you think about this from even like a reinforced learning perspective, can we start to capture this feedback and start to analyze and say, I'm getting a whole bunch of negative responses. Are we able to start to go back, see how this campaign might be evolving over time, based off the feedback that we're getting, this is all kind of a step. So it could be thinking about through the, through this tutorial, um, to kind of prove out that end to end experience and give you that feedback learning. Um, and then one last piece is you'll see, kind of at the bottom of the sky simulators, which is really allowing you to even start to simulate these responses, um, without ever having to necessarily leave, you know, this cortex box, where would be able to achieve all of your thoughts, kind of in the, uh, the balance cortex P sex from a development perspective.  Um, so that's, that's, you know, a very brief overview on kind of how we're seeing maybe some of these components come together. And, uh, sir, we just started to outline kind of the dependencies, um, from, you know, what are some of the things that would be required from an ads perspective, an object model search perspective.","Let's just kind start with, the, the overall flow of how we're seeing this unfold and the ads group where the developer portal as a developer can able to create an API and push in Git-hub repository and build server like bamboo and create version of that API that should be a super simple flow. "

"Once the summary given by Amit and Dhanuj is received by Hrisheek and Divesh. You guys look at the look at each sentences and see what kind of topics are present there and based on that, you will have to extract those major topics. So suppose, suppose in the first meeting we discussed about, uh, uh, I guess Bhanu asked the question that by handwritten mom is required. So then, Kajari explained and the entire thing. So with that, the topic extracted can be importance of mom, uh, importance of manual mom. So like that for every sentence or every paragraph that we are summarizing. First, we have to check whether there is an important topic or not. And if there is an important topic, what is the topic present there? And based on that, you will have to train the model. So as of now, obviously there is a lot of manual work as well, but then only we can train the model. So first look at the transcripts and come up with a strategy. So either you can use any NLP algorithm, or if you are feeling that an NLP algorithm will not work, then you can create a rule based. ","Check for important topics .

And once you start getting into the operational side of the names, we need to start considering, uh, what are the SLS that we want ads to run, uh, to expose and, uh, the services behind it. Where are the SLS that they're going to build, uh, to, to tell whether or not they're where they're hitting their objectives or their, their requirements. And so there's, there's a whole group of users that we need to make sure that we tie in from the operational perspective as well too. Cause it's more than just a building. It's also about operationalizing it and making sure that this thing can horizontally scale in a way that, uh, that we can also manage. And so we didn't make sure that we, even if we.

"In fact, the cloud native Telekom, uh, actually, uh, I've I kickstarted, uh, significant efforts within that, that are, that are being consumed by, uh, groups such as, uh, AT&T bell Canada, uh, former belt, France, or France telecon with I'll call the orange. And I was also being taken up by vendors such as Cisco Ericsson and, and so on. So, um, so I do have a background in networking. If anyone has a deep interest in networking, I can go in detail with that stuff. Although I don't want to go too much into that right now. Um, but in short, they do have a shared, uh, a shared requirement, which is the capability to scale and the capability to get high throughput. So, which I believe we will eventually need as well.  Cool. So let me get started. So I wanted to start from the beginning and one of the problems I've had, uh, that I've been trying to identify is what exactly is work lesson? So what I did was I put together a mock mission hour, a straw man, and so, uh, simplifying and accelerating application ideation development and deployment of data, rich applications, which incorporate privacy preserving technologies. So this is a first draft. Um, I, and I can pass this around you in order and help me just to make sure we're all on the same page. And so the idea, the idea is that everything we do should, uh, should work with whatever mission we choose or whatever it is that we're trying to, we're trying to do. If we don't understand what we're trying to do, then we're gonna, we're not going to be able to convene and we're much more likely to fail.  And certainly not at the 42 days, uh, market, if we can, we can not even decide what it is we're even trying to do in the first place. So this is my, my mock version of that and how I framed my initial set of questions around this. Um, so in terms of goals, there's, there's three major components or three major themes that I was able to identify upfront. There may be others. If I, if there are other themes that need to be in play, um, let's make sure that we discuss those as well, because we're, we're still in the process of building this context. So the first one is the concept of a native integrated developer environment that facilitates the creation of the, uh, of, of the workloads that we wants to do. We want our developers to create, uh, for those of you who are familiar with Jupiter network, uh, Jupiter notebooks, these exemplify the approach, but it's not the only way to do it, but they are indicative of the type of approach we want to take.  If we want to take something very simple, developers can type into, they can run, they can test, they can get deployed into, into an environment. We are also looking at, uh, how do we integrate with a variety of data sets and how do they integrate between workloads? And so there's also an important integration aspect that we cannot ignore. The second part is a declarative data and execution pipeline of which we are relying heavily on cognitive scale for, and this needs to have the capability to integrate all these workloads together, to be able to build a graph that should, that has a build, uh, starting from source through the topology to a sink that allows us to, to build and manipulate these, uh, these pipelines. Um, and declarative means that we're not putting down the small details on the bottom, but instead we're outlining the very top structure that we want.  And we let the system orchestrate that, uh, that structure, um, sources and sinks may include databases, workloads, API APIs, but they're not limited to these or maybe other types of sources and sinks that we identify over time that we may have to support. The third major group is, is we have to consider an ontology and the reason we have to consider ontologies. So is that when we build the model up, we are expecting these variety of workloads to work in tandem with each other, to, to work with each other. If we ignore our deontology, then we are, we may end up with line compatibility, but not have model CA compatibility at the top there speaking different, different languages. And so, so we need to make sure that we carefully curate over time a, uh, an ontology or a set of ontologies in order to help maximize the chance that the law is integrated with each other, not a priority for this milestone. It is something we will have to focus on as we move forward. Yeah,  Yeah. So, Hey Patrick, this is Denielle so quick question. This is the goals from a vocal as end result and product perspective and yeah, so I think what we need to do. ","In the cloud native Telecom I have worked with AT&T bell canada, France Telecom and with vendors such as Cisco ,Ericsson and so on. I have a background on networking. To identify what exactly is work lesson, I put together a mock mission hour, a straw man. So as to simplify and accelerate application ideation development and deployment of data rich applications, which incorporate privacy preserving technologies. This is the first draft. There are three major components that I was able to identify. The first one is the concept of a native integrated developer environment that facilitates the creation of the workloads that we want our developers to create.

"I'd say as a followup to, to today's discussion, uh, we probably need to, uh, kind of break down, uh, the journey to Skywalker and re uh, while also, you know, kind of, there's some components that are fairly well-defined and a bit working, uh, independently for awhile, like ACS. And, uh,  been working on with, um, ADC, right? Anthem, you know, the developer tools and all the work that's happening there. Uh, the integration of all of these, um, I think it's still a work in process. I know we've had discussions with all pretty much every stream, but I don't think we've put a overall integration architecture view together that everyone's reviewed and is, uh, you know, sort of settled on to say that is how we're going to go work on this. So that's a to-do and, um, you know, I think, you know, Ted I'll let you offline, uh, define the steps that are going to be needed to, to go get that done.

So the data strategy needs to be discussed for this to be effective, to solve some more complex problems, uh, for some easier problem, I guess we would be fine that wouldn't be AI data science track, right? That's one thing. The other thing I think, uh, a lot of that stuff need to be automated. It's really, shouldn't be a developer trying to manually figure out where to pull the data and stuff.

"Cortex and what it is that we do. So what I thought would be, you know, a good, a good demonstration is, you know, showcase our tooling and how we can together create this, you know, cognitive application. And we want to do this, you know, through a single channel in this case, imagine we want to create a very intelligent chat, right? What would that take? So what we have is a simple user interface, um, and I just want to post, you know, a very simple question. So imagine I'm a member to Anthem and I asked him, my claim was denied. I'm getting, I want to know why you didn't pay it. And I get back a very generic response, right? What claim for your furniture? And the reason that I'm getting this specific response is because on the back end system is currently hooked up. You know, there's no real understanding of the sentiment texts or any contextual information about myself.  So what I want to do is kind of show you kind of that backend system, that's sliding this interaction, which really gets into, you know, a little bit more on the detail. So our tooling aspect, and this is what we call our visual workbench, um, cortex studio. So think of cortex studio, where the role would be a low code developer, where I have all these assets and I want to start to almost glued them together, a great orchestrate and to compose a much richer experience. And what you see here is, you know, a single skill that I have on my campus, which is, uh, entitled conversation. This is a wrapper to some dialogue engine, think of this as an interface where I'm pointing to some concrete implementation. Uh, what we have right now deployed, it is four different implementations. One is pointed to Watson. One is pointing to Google, Amazon, Microsoft.  Um, I'm just going to point to the Watson's API, uh, but you can easily add your own implementations to this. And so in this tool, let's say, I want to enhance it with potentially, uh, understanding. So what I've done is I've gotten my canvas. I've clicked on add scale and I'm brought to this, uh, AI trusted health. This is a catalog of all of my assets where developers can start to contribute. And what I can do in this is I can find a specific scale, which is all around and I've added it to my canvas. And what I want to do now is use the tool to wire. These two skills together. What I'm going to have now is, um, tone and conversation, uh, working together. And I just saved what I call my agent or my application. And what I'm going to do now is go back to my chat bot and I'm going to ask the exact same questions. And so what it's doing now is just taking the tone and is providing that as contextual information to the conversation. And you can see based off of stitching these two skills together, I get now a slightly different response. It's taken the frustration, that's portrayed in my texts, and it's adding that as context to a conversation, giving me a different result. However, the end result is still kind of insane, but clam where your throat, so all of this is slightly better, right? Let's go back and add some more skills to really get to the heart.  So the next thing  I'd like to do is add document classification. So document classification, thinking, it says being able to take images, um, and start to, uh, process, you know, how you classify those, those specific images and even start to maybe extract out some of the activities. And again, just very quickly just grabbed that asset, brought it under a canvas, and I'm going to go back now and, um, just try a different multimodal experience instead of typing. We can Paul my claim was denied and I'm getting a huge bill. Why didn't you pay. ","What is cortex and what it is that we do in order to explain this so what I thought would be a good demonstration is, you know, showcase our tooling and how we can together create this cognitive application.

Uh, so the SRE team is the operational team at cognitive scale that manages their own clusters. And so they're putting us in contact with them so that they can help us set up those clusters as well.  Um, these, these are being done through Ben Michigan. So, uh, don't let me be a barrier to that. Instead, if you have something that's urgent, uh, Ben, Michigan is the right person to go to for, for something that's urgent. Um, and we are also setting up an initial connection with the red hat open shift team, because we want to make sure that we know who we're dealing with and what are the proper ways to get support to there. Once we start to do stuff with the open shift path is as well. Um, and that's in contact context with the OpenShift stuff going on above in terms of, uh, cloud native IDs. I've, I've heard, I've been personally serving a couple of forms of ideas just to, just to develop ideas. Uh, the ones I've looked at are equipped Che Jupiter, Jupiter hub. Um, I will need some recommendations on other things for, to, to investigate. And there's also a recommendation from the cognitive scale team to interact with a organization called Argo. So I'll be reaching out to Argo in the near future. The next. ","We are in the process of standing up a cognitive scale cluster. I've directed the team to first establish a cognitive scale cluster on EKS and Anthem AI. we will simultaneously be setting one up in the Anthem, BBC. once this is done, we have a stretch goal of opening an OpenShift version there as well. And we are also in the process of establishing a relationship with the cognitive scale SRE team who will help us in setting up of clusters. These are being done though Ben Michigan. For something urgent contact Ben Michigan. We are also setting up an initial connection with the red hat open shift team.

"All have here today, we will focus specifically on work coerce and kind of really get you a sense of a Watson division as well as what's been laid out as a kind of. ",Focus on WorkOS and Watson today
"The contractual obligations, um, yeah. And the implementation and reporting and execution and such. And so the campaign is meant more to be a unifying, uh, idea, uh, that allows for the business people to talk to us and also to associate budget, uh, within change. Right. So, um, ","Campaign is more unifying,that allows for the bussiness people to talk us  and associate budget."
"As, as an agenda item that we can touch base on. Okay.  And it's not linked to hello, Kathleen. It's it's more, those two things have, have to have their own version of the hollow world. Uh, ",Jive and Hive should have their own version of hello world.
"Bobby's got the Rolodex. Now, of course, you're building these great things with dev ops and all this infrastructure. So. ",Bobbys's has rolodex because you are building this great things with dev ops and infrastructure.
"You can search for the talent that we need.  Yep. So we're actually starting. So we'll, we'll jump ahead a little bit, but so the talent piece, if you hold onto that Ridge out for just a second, we've actually already started engaging legato and onshore, uh, engineers, um, in this work here. So, um, niche, anything, any nits or naps that you need here? ",Search for the talent that we need. We have started engaging Legato and onshore engineers in this work here.
"So, so John, are you looking at two different personas doing one on the API and the one on the other side of the spectrum on the cortex, you would see another developer going and creating this orchestration for the hello world. He's at how the vision is. Like, if I go into it eight years and create an API, then I have to go into the cortex to kind of wrap the entire flow and call the member API as part of the cortex flow and plug it into the hub.

"I didn't even begin to think about building this new, this new architecture of work us. If we hadn't laid this amazing, super. ",I didn't even begin to think building this new architecture for work os.
"Well, I think in some ways the, in the background, but I think when Steve are already kind of working on, on platform emerges, right. And then I think we're good on it. It's a, it's a perfect use case for workOS. ",Steve currently working on different platforms and till now it's an ideal use case for workOS.
"You think it's feasible or Frederick feasible to write like a compatibility routine that, that makes sure that, you know, each of these components that are being separately developed does a, um, impedance check with, uh, with the other components. ",Make sure each of the components developed seperately and independence check with other components.
Yes. Yes. So this is kind of initial pipeline on how workOS is going to be work on top of ACS.,Introductory pipeline on how workOS will work on top of ACS.
"Be accessible at that discussion. Okay. And it was the other thing too. And I agree with just how you characterize it, which is AI to start, you know, including everyone eventually. Um, but I think also another important point should be AI in every application that we build, you know, it could be a small footprint of AI, but I really don't see where wouldn't need an AI to be a part of something. Right. It always, you know, every application could learn from its data, which has kind of. ",AI is part of every application that we build.
"Nice. Ok then guys, Thank you. Thank you so much for joining the call and, uh, with the other team members let's meet tomorrow and get the solid updates and let's meet at 3:30. ",Thank you for joining the call and let's meet tomorrow.
"So, so when Pradeep and I was talking today, right, for example, you know, scheduling has high business utility, um, and there's an API for it. The payment integrity has high business utility, but there's no, uh, you know, effigy interface, uh, for payment integrity. Right. And so, you know, right with that, just in terms of hitting dates, it's, you know, uh, razor says the simplest project is. ",Scheduling has high business utility there is an API for it but where as payment integrity has no effective interface.
"And that are building, uh, the, the profiles  For, uh, uh, uh, especially  We've looked for the X wing developer. Right? My expectation is we're gonna hire somebody and train them a couple of weeks. We're going to get, you know, three to six months of work out of them. And then like a gig worker they're going to go off and do some other jobs. And so we don't want to be investing a lot of effort in. ",Hiring and training somebody in two weeks so that not much effort is invested. 
"But, but let me think one thing, guys, I think there are two aspects to this whole development, right? One is basically making a delivery  Was life easy. ",I think making a delivery is one of the two aspects in this whole development.  
"Do it, I'll say with relative ease. ",Do it with ease.
Let's keep moving here just for time the ontology. Okay. Okay. ,Let's keep moving here.
"So, uh, that being, that being said, um, we're going to talk about use cases in just a moment. So let me, let me hit one topic, uh, on here, unpause my screen. Um, so two robots question, and then we'll go right to Frederick to get into this, but from  question, um, so Anthem core engineers. So, uh, we already have WGS claims engineers. We've got a couple of those. We're getting two from, um, legato, uh, memberships. So we're literally pulling who are the future engineers, the future workforce that we'll be using and working in this platform. Um, and they're, they're part of the journey at this point. So we're, we'll onboard them, but we've started to pull them in. Um, and so to be clear, these aren't the people that have been here for 30 years engineering. These are some of the people that have been here two to three years working on projects, maybe even a year.  Um, and they will be part of building skills, um, reach out to your point building, uh, uh, AI agents using the libraries that come in through, um, uh, cortex and then deploying software. Um, part of, they may not deploy the use cases, but there'll be part of this. We're building it as they are the customer. They're also the, the end users. So we're building it around them. So our job, this, this skill set is being, is being anchored and built for. This is our workforce has to carry this forward. Um, we can't be forever dependent on, um, uh, cox scale. ","We are getting two WGS claims engineers from Legato memberships. We have started to pull in the future engineers.

"Yeah, I think, um, you know, I feel that, you know, if you go to that definition earlier, John, yet you had that workOS is, uh, can you do, if you don't mind, can you go to the slide that you had, the definition of workOS? Yeah. So a low-code AI developer platform and everything. I think it's beyond AI.",WorkOS is a low-code AI developer platform
Yep. I think Sydney. ,"Yes, I think Sydney."
"Tweaking and supervised learning and all that stuff.  Yeah.  All right. Maybe, maybe just, uh, go to the high component here, the next, next slide for the hell of the world. So, so look, this is, I'll be, I'll be completely honest with everyone. This is my take on how I'm seeing things unfold based off of the conversations that we've been having in the past the past week. And what, what is starting to do is at least. ",This is my take on how I'm seeing things unfold based off of the conversations that we've been having in the past the past week regarding tweaking and supervised learning.
"Among the, the, the things here that we wanted to take advantage.  Did you have any Neo? And the D is how do we hook up the developer portal in such a way to each of these, these panels and functionality? ",How to connect the developer portal to each of these panels and functionality?
"Well, you know, I think one of the things here is, is we, we're not going to get to any great level of detail today because, you know, there's just so much richness to the, to this environment and the tooling and the design approach. Um, let me just say that I've, I've spent, I've spent a fair amount of time already on the documentation, reading through the infrastructure, going through the, the, the, uh, uh, CA AML, camel, uh, markup language model, which essentially is part of the way you integrate existing systems. And I want to tell everybody that what's here is, is extremely rare. ","We're not going to get to the details of tooling and design approach. On integrating existing systems,time has been spent on documentation, infrastructure study, CA AML, camel, markup language model study."
"Really build out this very rich, um, experience, uh, very easily. Um, I think the very last thing I'm just going to point out and I think, you know, the time permitted, you probably want to spend a lot deeper dive on here, but, um, you know, the heart of it really it's being able to start to provide very personalized experiences. And so this is a core foundational component that we have this Paul. So what I'm going to do is I'm adding, you know, my profile, um, to, to the canvas, I'm going to click save. And so really what this profile is, is imagine, right? I'd have the ability to, uh, stitch together this knowledge representation of a member based off of all their declared attributes that are being fed from your data fabric, from CRM systems and DM systems, all the observed behaviors around their click string and other work on your member portal, Sydney care, or call it in the call center and all the inferences.  So all of them, the machine learning models, all these outputs, right, are being produced and Anthem, right. To drive this very rich experience. I want to just do is, you know, S the exact same question, one final time with the profile now, right. It's pointing to, and you see, I get immediately, right? The right response. I'm looking to look at ways of how we can get a little bit more proactive or in an advocacy setting. While I may not have been asking about, you know, options that are close by to me, right. It's letting me know that I have other places that I could go to that are in network based off of my profiles, demographic features based off of the provider's demographics off the policies of what I have as in network. Well, all of this is kind of driving, you know, a way of how we're able to do you start to bring together a lot of these assets in this tool, and very simply go through and start to create this rich experience. Um, so let me just show you, I'm just going to show it very quickly. One last piece of the tool, which is all around, um, what does that profile actually like?  Yeah. Um, so this is our, uh, profile visualization tool that this is where you're able to go and start to identify kind of what the schema is, um, that you would like your profile to be. So this is actually an editor as well, so to go into edit, um, and I can start to add, well, how can I do that in this demonstration? And I'm just going to point out a few things, right. Um, as I mentioned, a profile for, you know, what a member could be, that's based off of declared information. So things like their demographics, how long. ","The core foundational component here is being able to start to provide personalized experiences. I add my profile to the canvas, I click on save.
