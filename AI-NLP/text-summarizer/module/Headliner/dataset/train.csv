transcript,overview
"Yeah so this particular login screen code you have already shared it with me right?. Yeah I have shared with you and divesh both of you. Ok ok got it. Yes. And uh this field I don't know the exact fields so I just mention as a engineering meeting in the dropdown, so whatever fields anyway it will be coming dynamic right there is an. Yeah then that's it from my side. Okay so did you?. Yeah divesh please go ahead. This piece of code is not working right?. So I think it's of no use for me. Hello yes divesh your voice is not audible. Hello yeah yes divesh. I think. Still some noise is happening. This piece of code is not working. Okay. So what's happening? So can you show your screen? So what is happening. Okay one second, I need to open all the files. Yes. Yes right. Yes so like in this case, suppose if you choose any mp4 file so it is not saving in that actual folder because the HTML file doesn't have some like some packages to top with the flask API. So himanshu said we can try with react js.So that js you can write it no problem. Js you can write it no problem, see If you write in react also you need to write this all the types of input types rest of the you need to write an HTML attribute. So without HTML attributes you can't create as a fields.. So divesh. Yeah. So divesh yeah so. As I said yeah the back end of this code was not working. So what we'll do is we'll see this UI part, which he has made we will just keep this UI part while the back end part, we will connect it with react. Yeah.. Yeah that is what correct yeah. Ok himanshu. Even I have shared with you and divesh right? . sequence criteria. Yes not working, not working. Okay. Oh okay then it's fine. So I have used previously so this code. Actually I was, it was running, I have used somewhere but not this project so when I have previous company I have used same code, might be the code was changed I guess I don't know so you can try with the react only, no problem in that yeah. . So uh suresh for this screen I guess uh as of now it looks video screen I mean upload screen, maybe later we will have to change it with to the Anthem standards so I will share with you. Yeah yeah yeah. Yes exaxtly. I'll share you few files which I have with me, so i'll share you, you can take intuition from that and you can change it but coming to the dashboard part if you can share it, the dashboard. Sure. Yes yeah so this particular part i guess we need to make i mean uh as of now it is i mean the buttons colour and everything has been changed but it is still, it is looking like uh what Kajari gave us. So I feel that, did you, did you get a chance to go through the fireflies and otter, uh websites? yeah. Yeah I have go through that fireflies so they have used the thing is no himanshu I don't have any color code options, so our logo both logo's are in blue colour so we have to retain the both colour so that is why I have throughout website I have used in a blue colour only so if you have any suggestion we can change it accordingly. Okay. So did you go through that slide I mean in the slide of Kajari where in the last few slides she attached a few screenshots from uh fireflies. Did you have a look at that?. Wait I'll share. In uh power point. Okay yeah the PPT right? . Yeah I'll share I'll share wait. Sure just share. So if you look at this okay this is the otter but obviously otter is the mobile one, but yeah, this one, if you'll see, just a moment, it's still loading, okay so this one the fireflies okay. So you can see here there are i mean theme is same, but the way they have presented it is different right? yeah. This is a mobile view right?. No no no this, which one are you seeing? You are seeing otter or fireflies? otter.ai . Okay then.. wait wait wait fireflies will come. Yeah sure. . Is it there? Fireflies notepad? Still it's not showing me, no you have that uh . You have that uh, PPT with you no Suresh? Actually that PPT. I think there's a lag. I think there's a lag, I think there's a lag, that's the reason we are able to see the fireflies only. Maybe there's a lag  with your yeah. internet connection. Wait now. I'll share it directly yeah one second okay. You just share me. Okay one second, one second. It is uploaded in our hive uh stand up hive stand up files.. Actually okay now is it visible? Yeah there's uh now it's visible?. so here, you can see the theme is same but the way the things have been mentioned, it's different right? Yeah. So you can see, I mean, if you compare this with the UI that, uh, has been generated, it's totally different. Here you can see You can see it's minimalistic, but yet it, it is looking beautiful. So yeah we were expecting something with, uh, on this theme And even if I come here, even though it's a mobile view, but okay uh, if you look at, um, um, maybe the, uh, the buttons format or the theme's format, or maybe even though it is looking like a white background but it is not actually white. It has a slight tinge of grey here  yes. right?. yes same was here. same way it's a theme where it starts with white and ends with grey. yes. so it's in grey colour they have given okay. and if you look at the buttons as well. this button is having like uh slight tinge of blue blue but not exactly. And, uh they are transparent, so uh uh. Okay himanshu. I have a few questions, so if I have implemented the same screen now, then it will be a problem for you guys will be showing so in the demo that time they will ask so many questions. No no no. I'm not saying to make the same screen. I'm saying. Okay. Take a hint from this. Okay. Yeah I got it yeah. Okay. Yeah just take a hint from this and try to make it here, it is looking like a website. Okay. Okay but uh there it is looking like normal I mean what we say, the POC that we make or something we just made just for the showcase, not for the production level. Right? So in our case what is the issue? Is that here in our case, whatever, the models that we have built that models are not that much level because here we are trying to get the funding so we can not make the backend beautifiul. As of now, because we have the least time but if the frontend looks beautiful, then whatever is happening in the backend. That is the secondary part, because whatever we want to show, we have a script of that. And we will show that for the three meeting files, but if they are, as the, as the rule goes, right, the first impression is the last impression. So this UI is the first impression. So like the UI you made for the login screen, the home screen, sorry, where we are uploading. It looks like a website, even though maybe we need to change the color later based on the Anthem format, but it's still, it looks like a website, but the second is It looks like a temporary work. I mean, I hope you're understanding. Don't take me. Yeah, I got it. Yeah. Um, so, but see if I have this, like this screen, if I design, uh, then uh, UI work, you guys has to take on. So because of that, uh, how much I know that in HTML so I can design it. No problem. So after that, you guys has to take care.. Yes. Yes. You design your, whatever HTML you will create. HTML yeah to put it in react there will be no change. Okay. Yeah We will be using your HTML only. So Okay. whatever it made that only we will be using nothing else. So if you, again, share your screen, I'm stopping if you again share the dashboard okay.. You again share the dashboard? Okay yeah. Yeah so keep it only I'm not saying to change the structure. Okay. Keep it this only. Cool. Okay but the themes but the, the way that you look at the button, it is dark blue and dark white. Right? Okay. There okay you can see it. There is a gradient that is a transparency. got it got it.  like all the changes make it beautiful. Right. Similarily it was lines. If you see overview and timeline, there are two lines here.Okay but, It's okay. We don't want these lines. If there is some kind of a transition that we are able to differentiate that. Okay. . uh himanshu I think we lost you. we we lost you yeah. Videos or. the videos of, uh, fireflies and you can get there. That's why, I guess Kajari told you to watch those videos. They know they have clearly shown there. Himanshu? I think he has some problem with I think himanshu? Uh he uh your voice is breaking in between, it was not clear. Okay am I audible now? Yeah yes you were audible. Yeah you were audible and it was all quite for sometime . okay. Someone called me on my mobile. That's why. But don't just now electricity came so at 2 minutes it will reconnect to wifi okay yeah. Yeah I'm facing some unique. Unique issues for the past 2 or 3 days. But anyways. Uh so suresh. Did you understand right? Yeah so I got it. Uh, so I'll change this couple, couple of things I'll be changing and then we can connect so anywhere right now, you can just connect with the code. So then the rest of the part, if it's working, then, um, we can try to change. Change some other things so in that case this creating a UI framework right this is not completed no. So this, uh, I mean, uh, we can say that for the last sprint UI wireframe has been completed, but for this sprint I have created a new user story only for the beautification part. So what I'm seeing, what I'm trying to say, uh, um, uh Suresh. Okay.  That, uh, one second. Okay. So if I look at your screen, and then if I look at my screen, one second, the screen which i have already made. So i now i am connected to wifi. So now, it will not be an issue. . Oh okay.. Okay so now if I open chrome. Yeah so it is almost same. Right? So if you see here, we have this thing also, and this thing also, but my website is also not looking professional and same I can say with yours as well, only for this page only for dashboard correct? So that's what. okay i'm trying to say. That uh the same thing what you have made on the same theme i have made as well. Maybe there are a few extra components here, but neither this is  required nor that is required. We want something on the theme of fireflies and otter. So that's why i have created the story as well. And, uh we can work on that together. So maybe we can connect daily.. Whatever work that you are, we can have.. we can have a connect for half an hour daily and we can see it if you are moving in the right direction. Okay that sounded good?. Yes fine yeah. So then now you mean saying the complete UX. You need to change the dashboard yeah. the design I mean the components will stay the same okay division remain the same. Everything will remain the same only the structure of button, the transition and uh some other elements they should change. Based on the theme of fireflies yeah. Okay I'll try yeah correct yeah thank you yes okay so uh based on this discussion can we complete everything by 4th march I think the development thing that JSON and everything is ready. We are only waiting for the UI and the connectivity. Right? Did anyone hear me?. Yeah. Yes sravanthi. So I guess yes so sravanthi, so the UI is ready only himanshu few changes, so that changes I can right. To complete it as soon as you might be there today or tomorrow.. Uh but that means the UI is still in-progress, right? It is not ready for the changes. Has to be made and then only it will be ready. Yeah that's correct. Okay fine. So that's why so sravanthi has. So that's why sravanthi has created a user story. So we will have okay that same story points allocation session. So at that point okay yeah. Okay. And I would like to ask you one more thing when you are doing this sprint 2.  I want to know how many have work and how many doesn't in our team yeah. this time I have given everyone work. So those who already have the work, they will keep on doing that. And those who don't have the work, they will be helping me out in the react js. Yes so this time no one is getting away with react js . Okay so um, comment on that review part and the stories that are in progress himanshu and the other one also, you said that would be completed by today except for the operations meeting. So only operations meeting would be a spillover for us. This rest all uh it would be closed right? correct correct. Okay so now it is 1:27, can i expect everything to be closed by 5? 3 stories, 2 in in-review, and 1 in-progress.. In review? Yes. In progress. Yes. Everything will be done by five, or 5:30 Yes okay cool I'll try to finish it so 4 only but yeah. okay, fine. So team, uh, we would be starting our sprint two from today only. So all the stories would be moved to in-progress.  So please, please, please plan accordingly and let us know the time you need to take. Okay. Now we'll start the sprint planning okay clear okay over to you himanshu. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So few more needs to be added and uh, I mean maybe add it. So that's why I have, uh, kept it blank below, but whatever I thought of that I will be going one by one. So first I will be explaining the user story. Then I will be writing the description. Then together, we will come up with the acceptance criteria. And once we finish all of these things, then Sravanthi today only will have this new story point, uh, that only tool that you asked me i showed us the same tool yes using only? yes. Yes so you decide if you want that tool uh I can open it and do it. If not, since the stories are very uh minimum here, I think there are how many?. I guess there are 10? Yeah. 11. 11 okay fine so um team, you decide shall we do for planet poker last time as we did or is it okay because I think here the most decision should be taken by Suresh even thought the ownership lies across everybody and the team is working on it. And also, uh Himanshu i would suggest you take the acceptance criteria from Suresh.. Correct for each user story sure sure. sure sure okay okay. So you Create a, you tell the user story and Suresh will come up with the acceptance criteria and. Got it. team. If you agree with the acceptance criteria or any questions on the acceptance criteria, you can ask suresh right now. Let's close it today or only now in this call, i will not schedule one more. okay got it. Okay and also the story points can be decided by the team.. Okay okay so shall we start? Okay. Yes yes please go ahead I'll stop talking. Okay okay So the first one is key frame, JSON creation and integration. So Amit,  I guess you have already done most of the work here. So the major thing is, uh, we have to integrate this JSON with Avinash.  So, uh, so majorly the team is uh I will tell you on one second. Yeah. So here, few buttons are going to come right as, uh, . You guys have seen or maybe I will open that only yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this below part. So if suppose a button is selected, suppose this one, then like this, it should get activated. So audio, video and snippets. Sorry. Yeah. Key frames. So if I click on this, then a pop up should come and where your all key frames should be coming. So now, uh, here, summary is there. So, uh, wherever you find that the screen is being shared. Okay. There, uh, in that particular, uh, what do we say? Um, um, if you look at the JSON, uh, we have the transcription JSON for each row. So for the transcription, JSON, for each row, if the screen is shared, there only the integration must be done for that particular row.  So are you getting me Amit? Yes yes yes so do you want me to show open the JSON and show it again? Yes yes definitely Okay um JSON i'll go to desktop.. Ok for example no not, not this okay I'll go to. To topics extraction. Okay, so this is the one for the first one uh which is the one? I have a keyframe. So I suppose I can have here.. Have keyframes. Okay then I can have a status it equals to suppose true or a yes okay. Yeah. Yeah. And then what were the things that we were having Amit? labels maybe label yeah. Label and time. Label okay and uh time is from where to where it is getting shown right? Yeah. right? Yes uh, this us like what I had done till now is outside of transcription, I have created this keyframes with, uh, folder containing the time interval, and then inside them, every image or screenshot containing the time.. Oh, okay. So can we have This logic that if this start time and end time lies between your folder list then we can have a status as yes. And label as something whatever is the label. But that time interval has 2 different labels. Different labels if that time interval has 2 different labels then we will have 2 uh this label will have a list. Maybe let's call it as list . So what I have to do is uh, take the time interval and then match it with mine and see how many labels get inside and then status and label. So I guess instead of a folder, you can check with uh okay. So in 1 folder we can have multiple levels that is possible right?. 1 folder what I'm doing is, uh I don't have I don't think we have much uh no it just one label and it's mostly yeah. Then we can go, uh with the  folder only, right then it will be only one label Extracted. So if, if this start time, end time, uh, comes under one folder, that means folder label will come here. Will come here okay. Okay and then we have path so we will have keyframe path coming here full folder path complete folder path folder path will be coming here yeah. So this is possible right?. Uh I guess yes I will have to  check again. What this time interval is greater than the folder maybe 2 folders. The 3 folders are coming in this time interval.. Folders maybe 2 folders are coming in this time interval. two folders or three folders are coming okay. Then let's keep it as a list only. So generally in this list, we will be having only one label, but if possible, if there are more labels, then we will have 2 or 3 labels present inside . Um, also can also happen like, uh, two folders, are completely inside and one folder can be half or maybe less. No issues.  then we will have the key frames we'll be having random pictures from the 3 folders yeah. Okay yes then we will be the path will also be a list having 2 paths or 3 paths right?. 3 paths right? So yeah so if a user like this is clicked so we'll show a label just 1 keyframe we have to show right?. Random logic so status yes okay . Okay yeah. Grey colour. Say maroon colour, if I click on this, so then himanshu sorry yes sravanthi . Yes sravanthi.. English. Okay sorry this is recrording Okay okay. Okay okay so um so once the status is yes. This will change from grey to maroon so what I thought is that if I click on this maybe a popup or something will come where the thumbnails will get shown. So maybe if I click on this one, small pop-up will come. And uh that will show.  So nothing will be required from your side, there it will be uh work. Yeah um, so what do we say so so we'll go to this path and that will make us inside the folder. We will choose randomly 2 or randomly 3 images. if there are 3 folders, then we will choose randomly 2,2,24, all the 3 folders.. Okay got it, that's what I was considering whether to give all the keyframes or give random uh single or 2,3 things.. 2,3 things. So you will have suppose, uh we will make 5 keyframes, UI and there we will have if there are 3 folders and maybe 2,2,1. if there are 4 folders then 1,1,1, and 2 something like what we will do. And then we will also also have an option to have a detailed view, as well later. So yeah I can write this logic as well. Yes. So you have to write this logic and then you will have to put it in the Avinash code hmm okay so this transcription I'll send you. 1 example, I'll just copy it so I have shared it . So for all the rows where there are no keyframes it will be N and label and path will be empty. empty. If keyframes are present then it will be yes and label and path will be having contents strings yeah.  So basically, uh, the status will be N when somebody is in teams otherwise every time somebody is sharing something . Correct yeah yes yes that's true that's right. Okay so now coming back to our uh this thing so description I'll write then acceptance criteria uh suresh yeah. you will have to tell us. So the first description, I mean, the description is that, uh, key frames detection and extraction should be integrated with original JSON. If keyframes are not present, then status should be true or false or yeah, false represented by N if present, then true if represented by Y and respective labels folder paths should be saved in a list.. you have done API also?. So I mean it's up to you. If you want. Is this?I mean you, if you want Avinash to access this through an API which means he sends I guess that would be the best wat. So he sends uh JSON to your API and your API populates yeah like that transfers it to. The next person, I gues you will have to create another user story API creation. Okay. Okay same thing I'll write here okay so so suresh what do you think it should be the acceptance criteria?. Uh yes himanshu so. Himanshu so we can go ahead with the same things. So in, uh, what you were expecting, the same thing, we can accept it. Oh Sorry so I mean you can just uh tell me I will just type it . Um, the point is what I asked has to mentioned so the point means what I need to tell so . So the acceptance criteria, is that a, uh, once all of these points are successfully completed. Then only the user story will be markes as complete. Otherwise, if any 1 point is not completed yes correct. Yes correct so all the stories so all the points should be in a like then it will be as happening. So then the user will get the success story correct yes. Okay. Sounds good to Amit anything else to add? I guess it sounds good. Okay perfect so 3 story point game we will play at the end. So okay so now suresh this is yours only. So here you will have to, so this one I have created based on the revised wireframes that should come uh after you analyze yes otter and uh fireflies and you will make the changes so yeah. Frames and uh generatoin of the HTML codes for the same so uh suresh can you give the. acceptance criteria for uh acceptance be that user will be visible to that. So a user can be in attraction oh uh sorry I didn't get you no user uh user flow should be uh uh easily visible to everyone okay using should be in a visible. I guess that that is uh generalized . Uh uh acceptance criteria I guess we have to be more specific yeah. Then the specific in a UI UX what uh in colour combination we can use in a proper hmm . Okay. So I will send you the Anthem standard page and based on that you have to make the changes sure um himanshu. So sravanthi I'm proceeding then yeah hmm yeah. okay. So now comes the, okay. First I will move on to this last one where, so, avinash you will  have to, uh, talk with all the team members, whoever are the owners of, uh, their respective APIs and, uh, we have to stitch it now that routes that you were talking about that routes you will have to finish it. finish it. So uh himanshu yeah one qucik question I'm sorry to interrupt but um. So suresh you are clear with the acceptance criteria ?. criteria and the story that is been given? Right so please raise uh if at all you find any anything more anymore story in detail you want to add let us know sure sravanthi now itself because it's in the planning phase yes yes you can always add 1 more story no problem in adding. Yes fine with that yeah. You understood the logic behind this right? Yes yes okay. Yes yes okay . Okay so uh what is this edit? Okay anyways. Avinash. So you understand right? What we have to do. I need to call all the routes correct. So it starts with you and it ends with the, I guess, uh, yesterday, we decided right?. we decided right? Anuj or avinash? Uh Amit someone I guess amit amit comes from right position.  okay. So ideally I need to create one more API which will call us the route or something like that or function uh . So all of I mean what you have to do is everyone has an API right? hmm yes yes so once you have generated the JSON you create one more JSON okay you save it in mongo DB it's okay and you pass that JSON as in. JSON okay  you save it in Mongo DB it's okay and you pass that JSON as in as a post request to suppose uh divesh. Okay okay now . You have to ensure that? Divesh team generates uh JSON okay okay and that JSON divesh team I mean divesh team . I mean divesh team saves it and in mongoDB and they forward it to suppose uh Amit Anuj . When anuj takes it and then gives another JSON and that passes to amit JSON okay okay and that JSON which is the final JSON. which is the final JSON, which I will be, uh, taking care of. So, amit.. will now be taking care of two things 1 uh the summary part and the 2nd will be the keyframes. and that will be the whatever it is the output coming from . Amit amit's API that will be the final API okay that we need to accept that the UI need to accept and that will be populated that will be used.. Okay that will be used to populate the UI I'm okay understood yes sir himanshu actually we have 2 options we can also pull it from Mongo DB like if you're passing as post or we can also pull it from mongo DB it can be from our escalation yes. Yes that actually that's what I'm doing right now. Also we can send post request any. So that anything is possible. So that means avinash saved it in mongo DB and then uh divesh will take it from mongo DB yeah divesh will save it in his collection. Hmm yeah divesh will take it in his collection and then Anuj will take it from divesh's collection and then I will take from collection. So how will divesh know that avinash has saved it in MongoDB. Avinash will run that code. So first divesh uh in the first Avinash API will run. If that completes then only uh divesh API will run okay. So that means there should be a flag that needs to be transferred to? yeah. Uh divesh. Not flag even if some error occurs the whole process will stop. That means you are saying that. I mean, So Divesh, is it still using an API only, right? divesh is an API?. API and uh so yeah. Divesh is still using API and uh so divesh is a stand alone API . Not stand alone actually uh he has uh avinash has merged all the routes in 1 file and he's running that file hmm. Because people can go to port okay so that yes means. Divesh route will not be called until and unless the JSON is saved in mongo DB yeah. Yes and also kind of like you can also run divesh first but we need uh I'm avinash's JSON that's uh us to decide but what to to but is the pipeline the sequence?. Yeah so let's say besides. Please go ahead was like request will be saved in the collection of Avinash and then it will get to divesh we and divesh API will collect the uh JSON from avinash collection. collection okay okay and then he will save It in his own collection and the same process yes will continue to yours. Avinas can show you the process the code the request to get 1 he will maybe show you after this. Can show after this but it it's working fine right? Yeah. Yes yes yes it's working fine. Perfect okay so if it's working fine then let's continue with that . So stitching of all the API's and generating the final JSON that will be feeded by UI oh sorry english okay okay. Okay. So the first thing is, uh, creation. . Of routes that will tell that will ask the next API to start a second API's output JSON to we save in 1 mongo okay 3rd each API.. Take the input. from the mongo DB collection for final API will be exposed publicly and UI will send a post only to that API which is Amit API okay. So yes sir uh 1 more doubt so in the front end you will call API right? Yes yes. So that API from transcript and when 1 API from uh the filter side which is of so. Okay so regarding the transcript, you'll call only 1 APU that API will call amit's API that API will call anu's API like that you saying right? I will call only 1 API. That would give me the final output. Yes okay okay understood.. no what we can do we'll call an API and that if that API can collect from my collection and that will be pass it on. That's when I'm saying so himanshu said we'll call. we'll call 1 API and internally we'll call 1 API and inside your API I will call anuk's API like that. So all the API's will be talking internally but publicly exposed API will be only 1 API yes okay. correct questions himanshu correct yes . So this acceptance criteria is perfect yeah yeah perfect okay so based on this acceptance criteria only you guys create your sub tasks. Okay create 4 sub-tasks and.. Uh yeah whoever is the owner of the sub task you can . you can assign to that to that person yes yeah perfect so now this finishes the individual uh tasks now let's come to . Himanshu. Sorry to disturb yes yes I think we have a call with Kajari at 2 pm inform Kajari she said you can join this call now . at 2 pm okay okay yeah performance okay. So sravanthi can we postpone this call again?. Sure sure no problem at all we can do that so let's connect at 4 pm maybe? Hmm I'll schedule a. schedule a call himanshu. I'll just ping you and accordingly I'll schedule the call . accordingly I'll schedule the call sure yeah okay yeah okay yeah okay thank you yeah bye bye bye thank you okay bye thank you thank you . Yeah thank you thank you thank you. Thank you thank you","Meeting speaks on Dicussion on HTML attributes for Dynamic fields and code for login/Home screen of UI Dashboard, the Anthem Standards changes for Login/Home screen, fireflies and otter websites and PPT reference usage for dashboard screen and themes implementation, Himanshu to comment on in-review stories and review the stories that are in in-progress & their completion, Sprint planning on Sprint 2, Sprint 2 user story acceptance criteria and story points decided. "
"Uh or 1:20, 1:30 call or 1:20 call. Okay. Okay. Yeah we'll have more output right. Okay next we have . Next we have this UI framework, wireframe design, UI wireframe design so that depends on whether Suresh's system is ready or not.. Suresh in the call? Uh yeah yeah. Yeah. Himanshu so today we have set up the call with uh Kajari, so regarding. Yeah.. The plan and rest of the jobs so once it's done then . uh I have asked for few softwares so that uh Ankur has to update . and uh then I can start.. So hopefully will be today, the meeting is over.. So we can start tomorrow or day after tomorrow. So can you parallely ping Ankur as well that uh if he can. No already I have dropped yeah already I have dropped the mail as well as so. Okay. In the mail I have looped with Kajari as well as so she. Nice nice. Will be . Checking with that yeah. Okay perfect. Yeah. So uh. I think uh Sravanthi. Yeah. This this user story may be get spilled over to sprint 2 because it is started very late and uh so yeah when the sprint is started at that time Suresh didn't have the laptop then he got the laptop. Correct. then installations admin and all these things so maybe this will go to the sprint 1 as well. . So what I'll do is I'll just push it back to backlog. Maybe yeah that. . Okay? Will be fine. I'll just push it to backlog and then accordingly when the sprint 1 starts I'll uh we can uh move it to sprint 1.  correct yeah. Okay fine so this one is on me, fine I'll do that. So any other uh impediments or the team is waiting for any other stuff here? Uh, himanshu two things on me. One is uh to fix this. yes. so that you can move it to done. The workflow needs to be fixed and this this has to be moved to backlog Yeah okay so any other stuff team would like to come up here or ask ?. And also if you guys have any technical questions then we can have the sync up next call. Yeah. There is a question, otherwise we can uh cancel it for today so if does anyone has any question then let me know.. So everyone is clear on what they're doing and they have no doubt right? team come up next time himanshu would say I asked but nobody said so. I'm I'm fine. Yeah so yeah. Yeah we have a good to go.. So we can go for the sync call. We can skip the sync call or are you want to have you, no we can go uh. Want to have you, no we can go uh yeah my side is clear so, so you don't have any, rest of the team?. uh yeah my side is clear so, so you don't have any, rest of the team? No I have I have 6 oh clock meeting with Himanshu and Kajari. So I'll if I have anything I'll talk to them. I'll if I have anything I'll talk to them so rest of the people have it. anything so they can continue I guess. So. sarika and nikita? Yeah sravanthi. Sravanthi uh from my end uh I don't have any questions right now okay let uh let me see if anything's uh team would like to give me on a sync up call so I'm just eager to join on other call now which we had scheduled right so. I'll wait for it. So okay fine so let's join the syncup call team might have some more things to uh so let's finish it off quickly if uh. Sure. if anybody is having any doubts they can talk there. Okay Sravanthi. Sure. Okay. okay yeah thank you have a nice day. thank you thank you everyone. Thank you. Bye. Thank you Sravanthi, bye bye bye. Thank you everyone.",Meeting speaks about the update around Suresh UI framework design and any technical questions to be discussed in sync up call without fail for having clarity for the job done
"Yeah. So the recording has started . So yeah, for today, it's your turn right, Avijit. . Yeah It seems so. Like there were two meetings cancelled. So I think today is my turn.. Yeah. So after Hrisheek it was whose turn? Your turn only or someone else's turn? No Amit So, Amit have you made it for yesterdays? Or Amit your turn is done I guess. No, I haven't made. Actually I will make todays one.. No, yesterday's one is also pending, right? So you can do the yesterday's one and Avijit can do today's one. Okay. So yestrday's one..Okay so I will do the yesterdays one. Yeah. Cool Cool So, okay. Coming to hive three. So Divesh, what's the update. . Can we also call out. So, Actually, actually  I wrote some basic python logics. Actually I wrote some basic python logics. It's working good. So,So I need to convert it into functions and it will be updated by end of the day or tomorrow morning. Okay.  So what you will be doing today?on that? What will be that task that you're going to do today?.  So I need to convert the code into a function. So in that function I need to extract the excel sheet and convert into a list and the list could be passes the main logic code. So I think it will be done by today or tomorrow morning. So I think it will be done by today or tomorrow morning. So, Sorry to interrupt here Himanshu. So as per yesterdays update he was saying that . everything looks fine. And then some more inputs need to be made. As of yesterday Divesh. So we have given this, . the total task is been given for how many hours, 8 hours which is a day. which is a day So. So in that way there will be a delay in completion right ?. so how do we do it himanshu, is it the scope. so how do we do it himanshu, is it scope that’s been given is less time ? do we have to increase it?. the story points! . I think, No I think the basic code creation in that what we wanted and the way it has to be done, already the logic has been incorporated.Okay  So all he needs to do is convert it into a function. So I guess that will be done. Right Divesh?. Yes Himanshu. Okay, can I treat it would be done by today? . Yes Sravanthi. Yeah. Great. Fine. So please provide your comments on your user story Divesh for today. So what you did yesterday and what you are planning to do today, so you just put it in the comments. Sure Himanshu Cool. So coming to the next is ""Meeting Setup date and time extraction and classification"". It is by? . Yah its mine sir Hrisheek.. Okay, Yah. Its on Hrisheek.. Uh, yeah, so actually I was, uh I, I have found a package and wrote a code to extract like data and time, and I found like, uh, under my example, it was working fine. So today I will, what I will do is write a module and try to run on our like previous meetings data, and I will push that code to Bitbucket by end of the day. So today this I will be doing . Okay.  So what I will also recommend you is that, uh, so obviously in the past recorded meetings, what we have there may not be multiple sentences talking about meetings set up, right? So you just create some dummy sentences. You can just think of like, let's create, let's have a meeting tomorrow, if that is the case or like that you come up with 5 or 10 new sentences and then try to apply your logic there as well. Okay?. Yeah, sure Sir. I was trying that way only, like, uh, taking out days name Monday, Tuesday, tomorrow, like that.  Yeah I will do that sir. I will update, I will complete this by the end of the day  . Perfect! Please provide the comments in your user story. Okay? . Yeah. Sure Sir.Thank you. Yeah. Okay,Thank you.  Okay, next is Escallation. I guess it's Anuj. Anuj... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sir. So, uh, regarding the deadline classification and extraction part, I've been using a cosine and Jaccards similarity for that. So passing the sentences as a list and then seeing it's if, if the days of the, uh, month or days of the week are coming or a date segment is coming. So that is doing fine, but regarding the escalation part, uh, there are not much, uh, I mean, not much sentences in the, uh, in the, in our, uh, that we extracted in the word files that we have.  So.. So what would it have to do it again? You will to come up with some dummy data and you have to train it. Uh, so you can, uh, on escalation things, you can take it from the actual meetings while escalation data you can come up with on your own, like 10 or 15 rows as of now.. Okay Okay got it thanks Sir.. So please provide your comments on your user story that what you did today by end of the day. So next is Bhanu, extraction of technologies being discussed. So i guess Bhanu didn't join the meeting. Yeah. So anyways, in the morning he showed me the code. So, uh, his code is working fine. He used a spacy. So I guess his task is all will be done by today. So I guess Bhanu is here right?, bhanu.. I don’t think so. Yeah he Just Joined.. Okay. Yeah.Yeah Bhanu please tell . No, no I speak late because there was powercut and there is no changing in my mobile.. Okay. No Issue. So you can update on what you did on, uh, ""extraction of technologies being discussed"". . Okay uhh, okay  should I tell now?. Yeah. So you just have to tell what you did and what are you planning to do today? That's it. . okay okay,  one minute uh  yeah huh I used Spacy, uh, like the task is within a dictionary I need to find in those sentences whether those names are present or not, let it be names  or the tech tools, whatever it might be? So I tried, uh from the sentence, I removed the redundant words like "" to, you have check its ""and all, everything that will that will surely will not be our target words. Then after removing those, then, within our dictionary, uh, for now I just looked, uh, if the words would be in the dictionary, I'm checking with, with the words present in the sentences after removing the redundant words.. later on, uh, we'll be, uh, I'll try to add multithreading into that. . So what will be your task for today? By the end of the day what are you expecting?. Today,  I'll try to, uh, add multithreading for this, because it's the same code for all the dictionary task. Right So before you start with multithreading  you convert it into a function first. Okay?. Okay, okay. So, will the task be done today? because it shows only 4 hours. So will you take more time on it because yesterday only it was in ""Work is in progress"". . Yeah, it will be done in 4 hours . Multithreading I'll do it later. . So the main task expectation is done Sravanthi. So the only thing is, uh, as he is having a small bandwidth he is trying something new to add as well. . Okay. So, Himanshu,  I just wanted to tell you if there is something else also that has been done, let's focus on what . Okay. So, Himanshu,  I just wanted to tell you if there is something else also that has been done, let's focus on what has been already done and that is . required for Sprint 0. . The later things may be as he said  that can be done later part. So I want to show . The later things may be as he said that can be done later part. So I want to show  . atleast by this weekend or Monday a couple of stories as the team is progressing  . few of them should be moved to done. We are only left with 10 days. So that’s One thing. And. Yes Yes, so that's why I asked Bhanu that first you convert whatever code you have written into a function to see pass the dictionary is working fine and if it is working fine the user story could be moved to done. okay. . Correct Correct! So please follow up with them and then whatever task that has been assigned for Sprint 0, let's move it to ""Done"". The extra things we can do it in the next sprint. . Right. So Bhanu please provide your comments in your task. Okay. So you just need to write today's date and then make a dash and then write your comments, that what you did and what are you planning to do today. Right?. Okay Okay. Yeah,Next Dhanuj. . Yeah for Anthem tools extraction, I wrote a basic code, a basic Python code, I need to convert it into a function like, uh, today I will be connecting with Divesh and Bhanu, like, because we our requirement is quite similar Yes so that the code will be the same. And, uh, we have to change the list only. . Exactly. So what you have to do is all three of you now, once you're, once the three functions of you have been created, you see, you give, you give the same input to all three algoritms, all the three codes and see which is performing the best. So just try two or three test cases, whichever is performing the best, move on with it. Okay. So by today, I guess everything will be in the ""Done"" state. So Dhanuj please provide your comments in this particular section. Okay Sir  So yeah. So sentiment analysis has not yet started Sravanthi because Anuj is busy in the first user story as of now. . Okay. And same goes with the extraction of names, because it is on the name of Bhanu. So I guess once Banu is done with today's task, then by tomorrow, we can start with this. I guess I have kept these two in the ready state and not in the in progress state.. Okay, so one big question here. . The Sentiment, the sentiment analysis that is on with Anuj right.  So as you said Bhanu, sorry Anuj is not having  enough bandwidth. So, so whoever is, will be moving,  the tasks would be closed today. So for example, Bhanu's tasks will be closed, I believe, today, once he writes the function. .  I believe, today, once he writes the function. . Bhanu, Divesh and Dhanuj, all the three people's tasks will be done today. Will be done, so can we Sir,Can I work on this. Yes. Can we assign this task to them?. Definitely. So it depends on Anuj, I guess your story is gonna take time, so maybe we'll reallocate it to someone else. Okay?, Rigth, right, So let's see, I guess Amit also asked that he wants to do this, so maybe let's analyze what is Amit's work and based on that we can see.. Yes, in that way none of the person would be . So Sravanthi, Shouldn't these user stories be on that to do right?. Which one, sorry. . So HIVE 10 and HIVE 11, as they have not been started, should it be on the to do? Or in progress?. That should be in the ready. Ready is there, but in this board,  on the left-hand side is to do so as it has not been started, can we move it to to do. Yeah. Yeah, I did that. See, uh, Can u see this. Yeah, right And what are the other ones you said that would be in to do?  have not started  ?. Yes. So , go up, go up, the first one. First one, the very first one. This One? , the very first one. Oh yeah,fine snippets right?. Then,Yeah,Then there is one more, which after this, come down, come down, blue color. One second. Yeah. This one, Extraction of names of people referred.  Yeah. Okay. OKay. then next is Conversion of code into this is again to do.  Yeah. Yeah So next is Avinash, yeah  Avinash what's your update?. Yes sir, So I haven't started working on. . First first you have to tell whether you are working on HIVE 14 or HIVE 18?. HIVE 18. Okay, So what I did was I took the misspelled words from all the standup calls, generated transcript, and I have added them to the custom vocabulary of rev.ai. So now it is generating the words like Pegasus exactly. pegasus is currently generated yes yes But the problem with rev.ai is that we cant add alphanumeric words. So T5, it should be T- FIVE. Okay. Okay. So, even if it says T-Five, still it's okay. Yes, yes. But it is generating exactly the words, correct words. Perfect.  So what you do today is you just add few more vocabularies to it whatever you can think of this based on our meeting. And then you just mark this task as done. . And regarding cleaned output transcript I've been looking at sequence to sequence correction model, which is based on L bi-directional LSTM. So that requires data, I mean, cleaned transcript, a lot of text. So already for the first four meetings. We have the red markings and the blue markings, right.. Yeah. Yeah. I will take that and take a look at it. Yeah. . Yeah, based on that. First, try it on first four and see if you can resolve on those issues or not. And then later, what do we say, Nikita and Sarika will be sending you more files and then you'll have to incorporate that as well. But as of now, let's just start with the first four and let's see if you can make a note. So you  can mark your comments in HIVE 18 and HIVE 14. Right?. Yes. Perfect. And is this the story where in we have to make some changes in the acceptance criteria?as per yesterdays conversation. And is this the story where in we have to make some changes in the acceptance criteria?as per yesterdays conversation. Yeah only  small few lines needs to be added. I will add it it. Just after the call I will add it. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Next is Amit, complete transcript summary. . Yeah. So yesterday I worked on the transcript overview, I researched about it, I found two models for like which generate kind of a headline for our meetings. The first one need to be trained for that I require data which I currently dont have. and the other model which i found is already pre trained on 500,000 articles. I ran it for one of our meetings and let me show you the result.. So huh, okay!. So, uh, can you see my screen?  . Yes. Yes yes. So, So uh, this is, the last form  the headline generated. . okay, how to..ok So in this meeting we are only talking about scrum?. Yeah, we are talking kind of more about the scrum, but I guess today I'll research more about this model and see if we can finetune this model so that it will have the vocabulary of workOS and Anthem.. So before fine tuning your try, like you have given the entire, uh, minutes of the meeting, right. Maybe you break the minutes of meeting into four parts and then see if you're getting four lines. Like what kind of summary you are getting for four lines on what kind of, yeah. What kind of summary you are getting for four lines? Four paragraphs, sorry, because as of now, I mean, yeah, so then we will get four lines and then we can say that, okay this is the overall summary. Why I'm not going to finetune because we are, we are having lack of time. And also for this particular POC phase, Kajari wants to avoid any kind of fine tuning or custom tuning. So that is why, uh, whatever is the output. It's good. It is talking about scrum. So it is giving us the output.The next thing that you can do is you can just break, your paragraphs and break your sentence into four paragraphs and see if you're getting four different summaries, which you can combine. And that will be the overall summary. That that is the last thing that you can do. And then after that, you move on to your next user story.  Okay? Okay.Right so Please write your comments in your ,by the end of the day please write your comments in the user story.. Yes, yes I will do. So Sravanthi HIVE 20 needs to be moved on the left-hand side to do,yeah.  Next is, where is it? UI/UX, So UI/UX Wireframe design, so I guess Suresh is facing some issues with his laptop, so Suresh are you there?. hi, Himanshu. So actually the initial set up is done. Then I need to set up softwares, installations, rest of the part. So hopefully I can done today or tomorrow. Uh, then I can start with the Monday onwards. Okay. So I guess, uh, Sravanthi we can move it on the left-hand side then to do list. . Okay. So, before we proceed right, Team.. right, Team.. Suresh, I am so sorry we should have done it the day 1, I mean at the beginning of the meeting, So Suresh is been in the team but he was having some . issue with his laotop and he joined the daily standup today for the very first time.. So Suresh please introduce yourself.. Yeah, so Hi Team. So I am a new joinee. So actually I have joined one week back, but I have received the laptops very late, so hopefully I can done everything with that. So allow meeting with those case, so very excited to join the team. So I'll be take care of completely UI/UX part. So, and I can do some more than a UI part as well as. So this is my exact role. So under hopefully I can help with you guys. So whatever needed from UX side. So whatever you needed, anything UI Side, so please let me know ask  from that. So no hesitate to anyone, so I can help you out. So how much I can do, I'll be ready.. That's nice Suresh. Thank you. And welcome to the team and welcome to Legato. . Yes. Thank you Team,  yeah. Thank you Sravanthi. . Yeah. So I guess tomorrow Kajari has scheduled a call.. Just because myself Shilpa and Suresh, we have recently joined, so feel free to join that call, um, to have more insights if you are missing any, the team.  Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah that’s all and Himanshu you have anything from your end?. Team, you have anything to ask to Himanshu? This is the right forum.. Hmm. First I'll go. So it's about the, Bitbucket thing which I mentioned in the group in the morning. So I have created a Bitbucket. Actually, it was created a long time back, but we were not using it only, I guess Avinash and Anuj and Divesh, they only used it, Hrisheek but after that we stopped using it, but now we have to use it aggressively. So as, as I told in the group, uh, we have to create our own, branch , sometime so I am sharing my screen for sometime. Yeah. Yeah. So like in the topics extraction Bhanu and Divesh and  Hrisheek are working. So any one of you guys can create this branch, uh, from your terminal and then you put your code inside this. So how to put your code. As of now, you can proceed like this, source/ML/Divesh, and inside that Divesh's code.  So similarily, Hrisheek inside that Hrisheek code and like that source/ML/Bhanu and inside that Bhanus's code  for topics extraction, same goes with Label extraction, filters, video analysis, and like that for all the eight epics I have, uh, you have to create eight different feature branches. Now Uh, where is it, once one epic is done once topic extraction is done, then the last three user story is first conversion of your code and giving it a structure, right. And converting it into an API, then generating a standardized, JSON, and then finally storing it into Mongo DB. That means these three things require merging of work of Divesh, Hrisheek and Bhanu for topic extraction. So once this merge is done, once this API has been created and once the Mongo DB storage script has also been written. That means we have all the three things ready, Divesh code, Hrisheek code, Bhanu code, all  integrated, that should be kept inside src/ml/final, that will be the final code, that will go, so later in the develop branch I will only look at the final section. Okay? This will be the only one only code i will be taking and putting into develop. So develop means we are starting the stitching of all these epics. Once all these epics are done, we will start stitching it. That will go in develop branch. Once everything is working perfectly in develop branch we will put it in the master branch. Now master branch is called the main branch. So we will put it in the main branch. So that will be the final code that we will be showing for Demos and later we are going to follow the same process. May be in future we are going to change this kind of structure, but as of now till this POC goes we will be following this structure. So I hope everyone is well versed with how to use github and bitbucket is nothing but github only,  it is given by atlassian. So those who dont know or have little, i am only talking about the development team, so those who dont know just go through an article, watch a video and then just learn how exactly pull push, creation of branches, everything is being done using terminal. So if you guys have any question just let me know.. So I feel this should be a task that should be created Himanshu.. So now that everything, whatever the team is doing that has been, that should be showcased. Nothing should be done at the backend and their efforts should not be, you know, shown. So let's create tasks for these. . these, the one which you have mentioned  instead of stories. Right? . Yeah. So Sravanthi the last user story that they will be doing, that user story will not be closed until and unless their code, any user story will not be closed until and unless their code is inside the Bitbucket. So that is the rule. So no need to create a new task, the user story, any user story supposed Divesh user's story, it will be closed only once the code is complete, code is committed and reviewed by me based on the, uh, Sonar Lint or any kind of Lint correction tools. And if it passes that test, then only the user story will be closed. Otherwise it will again, come back to the developer to rectify the issue. . Rectify the issue. Correct, correct. I totally agree. I understood the point, but the creation of this particular, uh, you know, what you call it, branches right,. that I'm saying let's create a task. It is not that we will not be closing the user story that that cannot be, these are the minimal tasks that, that is helping the, that would be going as a part of user story. Right. these are the minimal tasks that, that is helping the, that would be going as a part of user story. . Right Right. Right. So these are the tasks extra tasks. . these are the tasks, extra tasks, even though they are saying that whatever updates they have given that goes according to the users story heading . these are the tasks, extra tasks, even though they are saying that whatever updates they have given that goes according to the users story heading . the user story heading, the summary of the user story, but creation of this features or the branch. . the branch, the naming, which you said that should be mentioned in a task. So once they complete it, for anyone who has created it, so for Divesh has created, so Avijit has created, once they created, just lets move the task to done.. So once they complete it, for anyone who has created it, so for Divesh has created, so Avijit has created, once they are created, lets move the task to done.. So once they complete it, for anyone who has created it, so for Divesh has created, so Avijit has created, once they are created, lets move the task to done.. So once they complete it, for anyone who has created it, so for Divesh has created, so Avijit has created, once they are created, lets move the task to done. That’s it. So I will take this responsibility then. So let them work on their own user story. I  will create an user story on my name and I will create all these branches so that it will not effect them. So once these branches are created you guys can start pushing your codes. So once these branches are created you can start pushing your codes. Correct!. Right, So once I am done with that I will ping in the group and then you guys can start pushing it. Right And make an habbit of pushing the code. Because if you are not pushing your code and your system gets some issue, then entire effort is gone. And also when you are working on the server which is suppose AWS, then either you have to use WINSCP or Cyberduck to send your data from your system to AWS, but instead of that if your entire code is in Bitbucket, then all you have to do is GIT Clone, and then that will be a super fast process and that will also help in future CI-CD pipeline making, so always make an habbit, whatever code you write, working code, even though it has some kind of errors just keep on pushing it. Okay? As of now we are in the R&D phase. But whatever you put in that is being very closely monitored by the ANTHEM team. ANd then that code passes two kind of test, one is the Blue Optima test and second is the Sonar Cube test. And if you guys are failing in those tests, then it affects your appraisal and multiple other things. So as of now we are in the starting phase, so that Blue Optima and Sonar cube will not come. But after the march POC and Demo, once we get the funding and once we get the anthem managers assigned and multiple other things, then all these things will come into picture. So we are three months, so it is better to follow these habits. True Thats it, from my side.. Yeah, that is easily achievable. if  you are updating every time,  we follow the scrum rules, we follow everything, a daily update and daily comments or any, any impediments you are facing. Let us know. Don't keep it for tomorrow, whatever it is stopping, or you need any help from the team, let's discuss upfront and get it resolved. That's how we can go as a very smooth journey till March for the first demo. . That's how we can go as a very smooth journey till March for the first demo. . Okay That’s all for now, and now that we were having some other topics to discuss, going forward, maybe for the Sprint 0. . Let's have it. Usually, as I said, the sprint, the daily standup is supposed to be for 15 to 20 minutes only, if we are called as an effective team. . the daily standup is supposed to be for 15 to 20 minutes only. Okay. Since we are in the beginning phase that’s fine. . that's fine, we are extending our time next week also, we are fine, but, maybe from 27th onwards lets . make it a 20 minute only, give your updates very quickly. . and also don’t go in detail. just do whatever you are waiting for, what are you planning to do. just do whatever you are waiting for, what are you planning to do, so what you did in detail, we don't need it, you update the user story on that, in that way we can save some time. you update the user story on that, in that way we can save some time. Right. So what we can follow is, from 1 to 1:20, we will have this scrum meeting only give your updates. After 1:20 to 2, we will have a technical discussion where scrum meeting will be over. And anyone has anything to tell,  talk in details, any issues, then we can have that. Any sync up, any sync up thing you have, we can schedule a sync-up call among the developers and if needed, I will also join. And that's where you have to discuss the rest. Yeah. . any sync up thing you have, we can schedule a sync-up call among the developers and if needed, I will also join. And that's where you have to discuss the rest. Yeah.. Okay. One last thing before we move on. Hrisheek, Amit and Avijit. Please finish your mom generation today because Sarika and Nikita are waiting for those three files, then only they can start their work. Okay.  Okay. Sure.  Cool cool , Nice So I think that’s it Sravanthi. Yeah, that's all from my end too. So thanks team, uh, for giving the update. It was more clear than yesterday. So I hope, it is not hope. I know we will be the better team. So by 27th, we'll be very crisp and clear. .  And once Kajari is on the call she should be surprised by the way we are giving updates. Let's finetune ourselves and give the updates.  Perfect. Okay. Thank you then. Have a nice day. Bye-bye. ",Meeting speaks about update on Sprint 0 task deadlines from team member and providing suggestions when required. Details on Scrum process and scrum board usage.
"So yesterday who's turn it was?. who's turn it was to uh create the MoM? And who's turn is today? I mean not yesterday. Day before. Monday one was mine that I know. Sorry yesterday only yeah. Tuesday was Republic day yeah so Monday was mine. Who's was Wednesday after me? . Please check the list . And uh today. Sir It's actually Anuj, after you it is on Anuj yeah. Anuj you can start on the uh Wednesday meeting. The meeting and uh. Today? Anuj. Oh it's it's mine? Yesterday was yours. Today? Mine. Mine. Mine bhanu or avinash? Bhanu bhanu. Bhanu bhanu okay. So you guys can start today and uh I have also started not getting time to finish it, it's still going slow I'll also finish it. Parallely you guys also start. Okay okay. I'll share my screen let's start with the stand up  and then we'll move on to questions, which means technical questions. Okay. So let's just start with the testing. . let's come to let's start from the. The last one. So it's complete transcript summary. Amit yeah I have tested it yeah.. References so you can pass it to tested. so it's already in testing, so you have tested it? Yes. So it's performing. correctly right? Yes. Perfect so first I will. Move it to tested then I will move it to in review. Them that how you tested it and how you feel that it's working fine. Okay.? Just a comment yes. Is there any supporting document? Any accurate excel sheet or anything you want to attach, you can attach that as well. Yes I'll do. Perfect. So next is, uh, extraction of technologies being discussed. So. There is no updae on this. Um I knew bhanu I guess yeah. Yeah, uh, mine, uh Divesh and, uh, dhanuj all three of us have tested it uh in for an excel sheet of transcript.. Okay so that means yours and hive 3 and hive 5 all are completed right?. Uh all. Uh all. Yes from your side it's , completed in this. Upto hive, sorry. Hive 7 is completed right? Tested. Yeah yeah 3 and 7. 3 and 7 there are no comments here. uh I we'll update so this is in review yeah yeah. we'll upload the, you guys have written. So I know that you guys have written a common code and you guys have uh incorporated all your code snippets into 1 function. But this is the individual story so. So what you specifically has done have done, you just comment on this and then how you have tested it . you comment on this okay okay okay. I am putting it on tested first then I'm putting it on in-review.. my review will not start until and unless you have updated your comments . or attached the supporting document as well okay okay. Divesh? Same goes with your user story as well?. Yes himanshu. Actually I have created the code in bitbucket and I put some cse file sheet cse file going to check. need to check, so uh so today I add. today I add some code in that main function to convert the output to JSON so after the stand up I will update on that so I will again push . the code un bitbucket. Okay so attach uh whatever is in the output or whatever . whatever you want with the comment. Okay? Sure. . Sure himanshu. Even though the function is almost same, but you guys are able to extract tools and whatever is your individual user story using that function right? Yes . Because why I am asking this is because when the sprint review call will take place even though you have written this common function, but suppose divesh, you will have to pass the . the string which. which contains the tool and the function should extract that. Similarly goes with bhanu and same goes with uh uh. Dhanuj as well. Okay. after the stand up call I will update this. Sure sure. Okay. Let's come to Hrisheek.So meeting set up date and time extraction and classification. . Uh yes sir so, actually there are I have added the comments and attached the code so what is now currently I am like in excels I am uh running on the test cases and uh there were some exceptions there. So I am mentioning that in excel and I will attach that document today. And I will push the codes by end of the day Yeah yes sir. one or two exceptions I know about so uh those exceptions are a little complex side so we you should not uh work on it. Uh so you just add those execpetions as a comment here while others. those exceptions are a little complex side so we you should not uh work on it.. Uh so you just add those execpetions as a comment here while others other exceptions you put It there uh if it can be done in this sprint or the first 3 sprints, I will put it back to in-progress. Otherwise I will move to in-review. Okay?. it can be done in this sprint or the first 3 sprints, I will put it back to in-progress.. Okay? Okay. Okay so you just. Uh I am putting it in in-review but. Okay you have to add comments okay? What are the test cases? Which are execptions? Okay sir I will add.  What are the test cases? Which are execptions? Okay sir I will add. Yeah next is anuj. Uh yes sir uh I'll I mean I'm done with the code I've tested it I'll be uploading the file's output and then what I have provided the manual input. Okay. And you are able to do the clasification of escalation texts?. texts as well right?. Yes yes I can. Perfect. So provide your comments, attach the supporting documents and then I will start the review. Okay. I guess this task has also started which is creation of text snippets. So I will be putting it in-progress. So first I will start with hive 20. So already I know dhanuj uh what you are facing so let it let let me keep it in in-progress only. i'll have a discussion with you on this, in sync up after this okay okay sir. let's move on to transcript cleaning. So avinash?. Yes sir, so yesterday I've told you I've tried with a bi-directional LSTM Model, so it's not actually predicting domain specific words, so what I did was I created a script which will extract all the vocabulary for us from the manual transcripts and also working on one more model for spelling correction only RN based. okay. Okay but uh, we should go with very extreme model. So what about uh the plan that we will provide the vocab. We will increase the vocaubulary of rev.ai? I have. So what about the uh plan that we will provide the vocab. Yes sir, I have tried but uh rev.ai also like not correcting entirely I mean not correctly predicting all the domain specific words, some words it's actually predicting. Some it doesn't okay. So today you'll be trying other uh things which are doing the clean up right?. Yes as Sarika mentioned day before yesterday. All the, all the sentences were repeating actually from previous output and next output like some part of the sentence is repeating in the next diarrization output also. So I have removed that also.. Okay so uh whatever is the current update which means whatever you whatever are those. Those words which are causing you the, just add those words here or add those sentences here so that we can also see that. Okay these are the problems.. Okay? Yes I will add that sir. Yes, but uh compared to the previous transcript that we are getting. You were getting and after whatever you have done in the cleaned output transcript code it's comparative with it?. Yes sir comparatively it's better but not entirely but it's better than previous output yeah. How much percentage or if you want to quantify it how much you can say that it was better than the previous one?. I guess it entirely depends on the vocabulary but uh current vocabulary list uh regarding that it's better, it's 40% better than the previous output. Approximately 40%, so add, . Add this as the comment as well okay 40% is better. Yes I will.. Whatever you, whatever experiments you can. can do try today and if it is increasing to 50% perfect, 50-60% . If not, then write a comment. What are those exceptions cases and what will be the. Those exceptions cases and what will be the strategy that you want to review it. How you will review that. Stop stop the work, today is the sprint closure.. I think so. Date is 4. is 4 one second. Thursday, 4th is Thursday, next right? Yes yes, next Thursday okay then give it a try till tomorrow. Yes . Okay? Yes yes okay again get back tomorrow and see how the things are going on. But add all the comments. Yes yes I'll do that sir. Okay. Yes I'll do that sir. Next is hive 11 which is by Bhanu so extraction of names. Yeah uh even this is done I'll add comments. There is one rare exception I'll discuss with you later. Uh in the with the earlier code I was able to complete this one as well. Uh I'll move it to, you can move it to review, I'll update the comments.. So right now or after you tell me about the rare rare scenario. uh I'll tell uh suppose uh the name if the name was anuj and dhanuj, then some error uh like I've put for spelling mistakes I've put confidence score as 0.85 for uh right now. So uh Anuj and dhanuj if dhanuj word is present uh it's showing as anuj and dhanuj both people are there in that particular thing. Can you can you I mean if uh if you're not able to solve it. To solve it normally can you do something like if anuj or dhanuj anything which is 85% or 85% greater . if there are 2 or more words predicted can we have Amit or sorry anuj or dhanuj something like that? . Yeah we can, yeah so add it like anuj or dhanuj so that model is saying that yeah it is correct but little bit confused between anuj or dhanuj which later. A manual person can rectify in the UI. Okay. So make it anuj or dhanuj right now and then let me know I will move it to in-review and please add the comments you have not added comments for any of the user stories. Yeah yeah I'll add I'll add Okay so I guess uh for the hive 9 also some updates avijit sent me uh before looking at the code can you explain i mean how how the things are going uh Avijit?. me know I will move it to in-review and please add the comments you have not added comments for any of the user stories.. Yeah just like uh, from the excel file I just took up the like I filtered based on the labels and I was fetching the audio transcript and the audio snippet transcript on the label speaker name. and then I may uh converted it into a JSON. Okay so it was giving you the proper result right? Yeah. Yesterday the JSON format it was giving all . Yeah. The same file? Yeah exactly the same format. Perfect so. You took testing? But . The same thing?. But we'll be moving it into in-review. I'll sit with you to see how. Yeah. Yeah yeah sure. Yeah so pending admin access so the latest comments you have not provided. Yeah yeah yeah sure. . Okay last is uh this one I don't know why it's it should be on anuj's name I guess, one second.. Okay label extraction, yeah it's on anuj's name, so obviously it is dependant on this is done right anuj? And uh this will be done today. So I guess, yeah, then we'll start with this okay?. I guess from tomorrow you can start with this so I'll tell you. what exactly to do, I'll tell you, I'll connect with you and I'll tell you what exactly to do so actually these two are. Actually these two are one at the same thing but uh as of now in the sprint 0 you have to do only this, only you have to do give a structure to a code that's it, yeah..  you have to do only this, only you have to do give a structure to a code that's it, yeah.. So I'll tell you, I'll tell you. Yeah so still I will keep the to do only. Yeah so that's done. Also we have 3 in-progress, one in testing while others are in review and I still don't know how to keept it to done. Uh so Sravanthi, you were telling me. So that finishes our uh stand up call so I guess in the Nikita and Sarika side uh I guess are waiting for uh 3 minutes of meetings file. 3 minutes of meetings file. One from me, one from anuj and one from Bhanu. So anything else Nikita, Sarika you want to add?. I think Nikita is not available Himanshu. So from my, my end I have to submit 20 two zero uh from my end it is pending. So can I do it by Monday end of the day? Is that okay to you guys?. Yeah yeah yeah sure no issues I mean you can go slow no issues. Okay fine so yeah I have another question. So I think it's opt to ask me in sync up call or do I uh actually what happened is I had a call or chat with Kajari yesterday so she said like for a demo we want 3 samples. I mean to say there should be 3 samples for final demo right?. Right right okay. So so she said like one of them is a scrum call type and then the other one is an engineering type. So uh she asked me to follow up with you saying that which one to pick up as an engineering type.. So like uh we will yesterday also we had a scrum meeting sorry we had a sync up call right? Right yeah. That engineering meeting and today also we'll have a sync up call, so that can be engineering because there we are only discussing about engineering.. Machine learning stuffs here we are discussing about scrum meetings. Okay I got it. So these 2 uh different things we'll give you the data.. Okay. Himanshu here. No as of now like uh uh 1 is engineering, and 1 is scrum right? What what is another one as Kajari said. three samples. One is business meetings. Okay the one which uh yesterday the ADP one is a business I guess. Yeah that can be a business and you remember, you guys worked on 4 JAM meetings. Yeah.so those can be also business meetings. So we do have the transcript for it we just need to create a manual transcript and then we can give it to you and that will be the business transcript.. Okay okay. So I think I got a ADP uh thing from Kajari only so I can make use of it  Like for the instead of jam, I meant that in of jam sessions, we could make an ADP. . As an business. Definitely so we can start with ADP and later if we need more data we can go with JAM also. Yeah yea yeah okay. yeah that's it from my end himanshu. Perfect so for the sake of. Sake of engineering meeting. I thought that let's continue here. Only the sync up call but. for the sake of engineering,  for the sake of separate engineering meeting and separate transcript generation let's connect in a sync up call and let's discuss because I guess for the dhanuj uh code we have to discuss few things and avijit wanted to show something, so let's connect on it on the sync up call okay? . Okay. Okay thank you and Himanshu I'll be not joining in that sync up . Okay thank you and Himanshu I'll be not joining in that sync up call is that okay? No issues no issues. Yeah yeah Okay. Thank you so much guys. Thank you so anyone who don't have any update or. Don't have any questions, It is not necessarily that you should join the sync up Okay. So you guys can, uh, proceed without joining the call. Those who have they can join the call. Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye bye.. Thanks bye. Thank you, thank you.",Meeting about the story updates on Hive sprint 0 day activities and the team getting suggestions for the task and the action items for the day.
"Hi Himanshu. Yes avijit hi yeah. Yeah like uh you also like you told me that you will be organizing a KT for me like I also joined to send in this project now basic idea for this project. Cool so at 3:30 I have meeting with Shilpa and sravanthi so at the same time you can also join and yeah you can have. yeah sure. so today who's uh MoM writing, date was the 3rd person.. After bhanu it was me sir but uh I'm the 4th guy. you are the 4th guy or third guy?. 4th so who’s uh I think anuj anuj was 2nd uh bhanu teja has did the 2nd position. Okay. So that means that makes, anuj as 3rd but I think anuj has resigned from the organisation so I'm not sure whether. How much he will be joining these sessions but anuj is here hi anuj. Hi sir. what happened? Suddenly leaving Legato?. Yes,  Uh, actually, uh, I, I will be joining, uh, uh, a bank. So so you will be he got better offer sir. which company?. Uh, actually, I got two offers from Morgan Stanley and Barclays, so I haven't told anyone. Yeah finally you got your financial domain. Yeah, I was applying for the finance yeah jobs. Yeah. You will be part of these meetings until you formally leave the company. . Yeah, exactly. Uh, requested for a weaver of one or 2 months let's see what head HR decide until then I'll be a part of this. Yeah cool. So  let me give you the work. So I guess today it's your turn to take the uh minutes of meeting. Yeah. okay so whatever Is the discussion as much detailed as possible and just write down.the points okay? . Ok sir. Maybe you can use paper and pen that will be a little faster because this MoM. and pen that will be a little faster because this MoM is not for uh like general MoM so which we upload in confluence this is for the model training so. But thi is for the model training so a little but detail will be required yes sir. Yes sir. So, okay. So I'll repeat whatever I said before the recording. So avinash you have done for the first video, you have done the classification task as well. So now for the second video, you do the same thing. Uh, tell the classification and both the Excel sheets you can share So that will be the first task done. Then one second  let me share that, uh, um, that Excel sheet where I created the plan. One second.  . Yeah so is my screen visible? yes sir yeah. Okay. So let's just start with Avinash. So, anyways, as of now we are following this uh particular table, but once the scrum and everything is done, then we will be following the exact scrum rules. . So all these tasks that you are seeing that you will be. getting. Getting assigned with uh, epics and a task is beside them and based on the sprint planning. We will continue. But for this week, uh, till uh, uh, sravanthi's completely onboarded into inside this project, maybe we'll have to continue with this particular table.  Okay so for avinash speaker diarization is done with for first video the second video you guys will generating now the next thing is spell checkers and summary clean up so actually spell checker is part of summary clean up only so avijit and avinash you both will be working on this so avijit. I will be giving you the KT at 3:30 but still. . You can parallely work with avinash yeah sure on the summary it's a normal NLP task. So you can, I mean, uh, for the first video you have the MoM, the manual MoM as well. as The generated transcript. So you will, you both will have to see what kind of error so avinash the same task, the red pointers that you had in the previous Excel sheet, same thing you will have to do. You both have to come up with a strategy, like how this can be automated, whether we have to create a custom dictionary, or uh, anything. So first you will have to compare both the transcripts and then come up with the strategies based on that. So once every. Avinash you also shared, you shared it with the WhatsApp i mean sorry the team's group then i will also have a look at it i will also compare and maybe i'll also. . same thing you will have to do. You both have to come up with a strategy, like how this can be automated, whether we have to create a custom dictionary, or uh, anything. So first you will have to compare both the transcripts and then come up with the strategies based on that. So once every avinash you also shared, you shared it with the WhatsApp i mean sorry . The team's group. . then I will also have a look at it. I will also compare and maybe I will also come up with the ideas. but parallely, you both also look at that and come up with ideas okay?. But parallely, you both also look at that and come up with ideas. Okay. Next.. thing is amit and dhanuj. So text summarization, so you will be finding the actual transcript and you will be having the MoM. So you will have to see what are the exact, uh, sentences in the generated transcript, which matches with the MoM. And then based on that, you will have to summarize. So obviously the summarization will be the normal process which you have been doing using Pegasus or T5 after that you will have to see after the summarization, what are those important things and what are not? So you continue with the text summarization, and then after that you will be, uh, giving this summary to, uh, I guess, uh,hrisheek and divesh. You have been doing using Pegasus or T-5 after that, you will have to see after. the summarisation what are important things and what are not?. Hrisheek and divesh for topics.. topics extraction and, uh bhanu and, uh, anuj till anuj is in the team bhanu. Once anuj leaves the team and we don't have any replacement. And I guess bhanu will join, hrisheek and divesh and because intent extraction or topics extraction, they are almost same. The only thing is. . I know he leaves the team and we don't have any replacement.. intents will be predefining. That means we already know that we will. . We already know that we will be classifying questions, exclamations and, uh, some special tasks like that, while topics extraction, like what is the theme on which we are talking about? So whether we are talking about workOS, we are talking about Docker in that particular sentence. So like that you will have to extract those topics. Meeting so. Anyone saying anything okay so once the summary. Once the summary given by amit and dhanuj is received by hrisheek and divesh, You guys look at each sentences and see what kind of topics are present there and based on that, you will have to extract those major topics. So suppose in the first meeting we discussed about, uh, uh, I guess bhanu asked the question that why handwritten MoM is required. So then, uh, kajari explained and the entire thing. So with that, the topic extracted can be importance of MoM, uh, importance of manual MoM. So like that for every sentence or every paragraph that we are summarizing. First, we have to check whether there is an important topic or not. And if there is an important topic, what is the topic presented? And based on that, you will have to train the model. So as of now, obviously there is a lot of manual work as well, but then only we can train the model. So first look at the transcripts and come up with a strategy. So either you can use any NLP algorithm, or if you are feeling that NLP algorithm will not work, then you can create a rule based algorithm. Look at each sentences and see what kind of topics. are presented. You can create a rule based algorithm. So that means maybe mapping. . So if this term is present, then it is definitely talking about this particular topic. So like that you guys have to start then coming to Bhanu and anuj you guys have to extract those themes. So questions. So I guess I have added in my manual thing, I have added. . The questions, but maybe. . In the actual transcripts, there can be more questions. So don't only depend on what my, uh, manual transcript is saying. You also look at the actual transcript and see questions. Are there or not actions, discussions, obviously that is there. What is, what are the action items? What are the discussion item, questions, dates. So if there is a deadline something has to be done before a deadline. So that can be one intent with the name deadline. So if there is an intent with the name deadline, then the deadline, which is the actual date that needs to be extracted as well, because later once you will click on the intent of deadline, then that sentence will come in the right-hand side. And then it will tell us  What is the actual date that will be extracted so like that if you look at the presentation which kajari has created on the left-hand side we have all the intents that is the task of bhanu and anuj while on the middle side there are all the what do we say let me share that particular thing as well so that it will become more clear so if you see here. As of now questions, escalations deadlines, sentiments. So whatever is feasible. As of now, I'm not saying that you do for everything, but whatever is feasible based on the current two transcripts, you just try to create a model for these intents extraction. Well, when I'm saying topics extraction, even though it's written topics here, it is actually.intent. when I'm saying topics extraction, even though it's written topics here, it is actually intent topics. Extraction means this side . here you can see at minute forty 44 second open-ended questions. One minute, 10 seconds. it is talking about funnel six minutes of it is talking about building a growth team. So this is the topics that we are extracting. So that's the task of divesh and hrisheek, and this is the task  of bhanu and uh anuj . which is you can see tasks, pricing, metrics so obviously we don’t have pricing metrics but we do have tasks so in tasks we can have discussion and actions, we have questions we have dates and times that are extracted then there are negative and positive sentiments so if you click on this it will be telling move in on which paragraph we have negative talks on which paragraphs we have positive talks and like that so whatever is feasble based on the two transcripts you guys have to uh start doing that and make a model out of that so that will finish or that will be. will be first level of tasks for everyone. And, uh,  Yeah.  . And then it comes to otter.ai fireflies already the platform architechture I have shared it with kajari uh there are few things that I need to add especially this feedback loop which i will add again and send it again while otter.ai and firefiles today i will be finishing the evaluation cool so any questions? so i guess major questions will start coming once you actually go throught the transcripts so i guess atleast by today i would require that you guys come up with a strategy of what exactly you're extracting what intents you're extracting what topics you're extracting, matching of current MoM with the generated MoM and like that whatever is the analysis you guys come up with that by tomorrow in the next meeting we will be discussing with each team. What is your plan? How you are going to proceed.further. That's cool right? Yes. yes. Perfect. So if you guys don't have any questions, then we can conclude this call.cool So I think we don't have any questions so fine so. so uh Sravanthi himanshu Yeah. himanshu Yeah. uh The one which you shared the list of activities, which the team has to do, right. . have you uploaded it in the teams Yes. it's okay I have actually I'ts there I'll check it again. I I'll check it again if it's not relevant.I'll upload okay i i'll just check it again sure no problem yeah.. so at 3:30 we all three of us will be meeting I mean four of us avijit yeah shilpa and sravanthi right and I guess bhanu if you want to if you're okay with the project if you've understood then its okay otherwise if you also want to join it to understand then you can also join it It's optional for you. I will just extend it to bhanu. . I don't think I added him Yeah. So bhanu and avijit are the two people by bhanu maybe optional, but yeah, till avijit we are mandatory it. . Okay. let me know bhanu If you need, I'll just forward that invite,yeah I have already got a invite But I think it's. no issues  . okay then guys. guys Thank you. Thank you so much for joining the call and, uh, with the other team members let's meet tomorrow and get the solid updates and let's meet. at 3:30. Okay then. yeah sure Thank you. thank you bye ","Meeting speaks about KT for Avijit to understand the basic Idea of HIVE project, Team's discussion on MoM genreation task divided amongst,  Himanshu discussing about the ""Hive Tasks Assignment"" plan with the team, scrum planning to happen in near future with epics and user stories."
"sentiment analysis used right so it is again on anuj's name so we have two stories which we need to get an update from anuj I'll touch base.. With him. Yeah I'm here. Hey Anuj.. Good good. So we, we were talking about the story which is in in-progress . You have two stories on your name. So you can provide the update for the both please.. No in-progress is only one right? Yeah, no in total. they have two stories. So one is in in-progress and other is. Okay okay. Yeah.. So the testing one is tested.. This is done? Yes. Have you attached the relevant documents to this?. The artifacts. No I haven't but I'll attach it today.. Okay so that people who have.. Team who have already tested. The moment you attach your related artifacts then it moves to review.. See it will be easy task for himanshu to review it what exactly you have done. If you don't provide any artifacts again himanshu will come back so that's nothing but you have to both your time will be you know extended, why do you want to do that? Right. So make sure. Ok I'll I'll. Since you have done update them here, attach the related story doc. Okay i'll attach it today. Okay fine. Yeah. What went wrong here. Okay let's move on to your in-progress story first.. Yeah uh here escalation part is remaining so.. So uh if I remember correctly on Friday also it was with the same thing right?. Same thing right? Yeah yeah I'm working on the algorithm I should use on this because I have created a dummy data set for this escalation part. Deadline part is almost done. Deadline part is done for so for the escalation part, I'm still figuring out what algorithm to use in that.. So you need any help?. Are you waiting for somebody to pitch in and you know you can take help from himanshu if you're not figuring able to figure out what  kind of an algorithm you can use here. Yeah.. Actually I had a call with him on Friday regarding this so. He he actually told me some of the algorithms I can use so I'm trying them maybe I'll have enough data. Okay. Yeah. No issues.. Yeah.. Okay. No issues so yeah I hope today you'll be working on this right? Yeah, yeah. Okay I mean the testing part. Right so once these are in tested the most work. most work that would be moving to himanshu to review and then he will be moving in to done. So as a team can you please suggest, I mean uh few stories are in to do phase.. and we are left with a week to complete our sprint.. So uh I can see depending on your other project's work, I don't want to push it on you. But if you can pull some of the other stories which are on your name which are uh which doesn't have any dependency on the some tasks. Can you please name them so that we can move it to in progress? I guess this has some uh. Yeah that I spoke to himanshu and he told. Avinash. Yes Avijit. Avijit sorry Avijit yes. .  Once we finalise with the. JSON, the structure of them then that task will be calling different JSON's and that would require the like some formatting to be done. Okay. Okay by when uh by today you'd been owing an information on this? I have to speak with himanshu regarding that after that I'll confirm with you. . Okay thank you and we have and we have the other story which is on bhanu's name extraction of names. Uh yeah uh it's almost same as the other three extractions. I'll have a small discussion with himanshu and I'll update you by evening. Okay. Most probably uh we can move it anyways i will once talk to him and i'll update you.. Okay cool thank you bhanu. And then we have this on uh himanshu's name I believe he has to uh move it to one of the assignee's conversion of code into functions, modules and classes. And, um dhanuj's name we have classification of type of meetings. Dhanuj you have any input on this?. Yeah himanshu suggested some few algorithms like uh but we are lack of training data. It's uh, Kajari said like uh the user will be inputting the uh meeitng type, so uh I just want to get some clarification regarding the data.. Okay. Do you want me to talk about it now? Or Sravanthi is it after the meeting?. Yeah so we'll keep it in a parking lot and then uh move ahead with. The rest of the stories . And once it is done we'll still have some time. If we have time we can continue, if not we can talk about it in our sync-up call. Okay alright then ping me I'll tell you. Yeah yeah sure. Uh okay. And we have the other one I believe . I believe this would be waiting for the rest of the stories to complete, again this would be uh going over or now? No no you don't need other stories to complete. . UI framework design, which should , which should be on suresh's name I believe right? Yeah uh Sravanthi.. Uh Sravanthi, so that I have requested few software so Kajari is evealuating so once it's done. Once it's done, then I have meeting set up with himanshu, then I can work on this. So. Okay. . I would suggest, also set up a meeting with me on Wednesday okay. Sure uh will do it.. Will do it yeah because of I need the inputs from you and uh himanshu so then I can take it forward.. Then I can take it forward. Correct so. Because of, your wireframe, your UI design should not be dependant on what the team is doing. Yeah that is correct. Yeah. Okay. Because . Because remember the discussions we had that, Nikita and Sarika, they are creating a cleaned up uh scripts. Those will be the hardcoded uh JSON for you and that is the JSON that you that you must finally uh creating. So for you having couple of those JSON's which is filled with already good results is should be enough to do the UI work. This way we can have two parallel transcripts.. Sure sure uh Kajari. So I'll do it for the design so then we can take. then we can take forward. Sure. Okay great so we have uh Sarika. Sarika and Nikita also, can you please provide your updates as uh what what is been doing? From your, what have you done?. Yeah, hi Sravanthi. Hey. So uh, we were working on the audio files of 18th and 21st and 18th was taken care by Nikita and 21st I was uh doing and I finished and submitted to himanshu. So we found some uh observations which I recorded them in the word document and submitted to himanshu which will help uh the team or or uh just want to uh know like if i am reaching their expectations or if anything else i have to do from my end so i tried analyzing the audio files where the machine is missing and uh what all uh to be added hmm uh and uh NER and Label, such kind of stuff i have uh worked on it, so uh i have submitted the excel the final output and the observation along with it. So i'm just looking forward for himanshu to get back to me hmm so that i will know. if i reached the team expectations or not. And then, Okay, yeah, it's really good Sarika.. And uh Nikita you have any updates from your end? Yes Hi Sravanthi, hey, can you hear me? Yeah yeah nikita please go ahead. . Okay so. Okay so yes I worked on the audio script of the 18th January..  I observed a lot of um, um I have added. Nikita we lost you.. Uh can you hear me now? Yeah yeah yeah now it's fine. So yes I'm also expecting a revert from himansh regarding my performance and. Okay. I have tried under NER and Label as I have experienced multiple speakers speaking in the audio. So that's the challenge where i am facing uh i will try to work on it from the next audio files i'm going to receive. and yes, that's my update.. Okay yeah thanks Nikita.. Nikita. So team while working on the stories or any other thing related to work or any other thing you have any questions? Or is it, are there any impediments that is stopping your work? Any dependencies? We have 3 minutes left you can discuss if you're waiting for something you need any help. Uh hi Sravanthi. .  Hey. Actually i haven't given my updates so uh hive. sorry your. hive 19. hive 19. So which story are you working? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I am I am yet to collect the voice.. Who is speaking? So, Amit amit. Hey hi Amit Joshi.. Amit Joshi. Right. Go ahead.. Yeah so the complete transcript summary hive 19 uh the testing phase. Yes , yes, so actually uh my code crashed for uh one of the test case. Uh, I have to modify the code for that and regarding that I'll also connect with himanshu.. Okay. So team, I could see that there is lot of dependency on himanshu.. So, uh, let's make sure I'll make sure that himanshu is in this call so that, um, . you don't have to wait for an update. Okay and in the daily sync-up atleast if you can join uh it would be great uh for today. Yeah that's one thing any other uh thing the team would like to discuss here?. fine we have two minutes left and that was a very good update I should appreciate you all on that uh thank you so much for your updates and keep working good job done thank you. Hi Sravanthi. Who is, yeah. Yeah hey hi . so yeah uh daily one person needs to create the manual transcript of that entire meeting. So on Friday, it was on me, so I spent lot of time in creating that so I didn't get time to work on the user story of mine . Uh you're talking about this. This yeah.. Yeah cleaned output transcript so. Okay. I guess everyone is facing that issue because every uh everyday it's someone's task to do.. Okay. So whenever you are, it is taking long time for you to uh do it manually right? . Yes uh for entire meeting we need to create that uh transcript. So uh. I mean lot of changes.. Okay so how many hours are you spending on that particular task?. On Friday I spent almost 3 and a half hours.. 3 and a half hours. But still only half is completed.. Okay. Let me talk to himanshu uh that. Yes. If it is 3 and a half hours for 1 person . It will be it will be uh big task right? So let me talk with himanshu and also Kajari. So let's come up with something and uh we'll get back to you on this.okay yeah. Thanks Sravanthi. Okay. we'll get back to you on this.okay yeah. Thanks Sravanthi. Okay. Yeah thank you. So any other. Hi Sravanthi. Yeah. Yeah so i. Yeah nikita. I wanted to ask regarding the training. Is there a category? Where we have to go and choose the training or the can we say anything from our side, what we want to build ourselves into?. So I think it is anything from, it is from our tower end . not at the Legato perspective right so it is for our team, not only for our team for the digital tower if you have to be very specific. So you can just come up with this suggestions which would be helpful for you uh it is it should not be. Obviously out of the box so. So uh make sure that whatever training you are you are taking it or you're suggesting or you want it that should be relevant to your uh work which you are doing. work which you are doing. So, and also any other . Also any other stuff you can just suggest anything accordingly we can uh you know. Figure it out prioritize which are the more important ones. Okay Sravanthi, thank you, thank you, okay, thank you for the clarification.. Yeah yeah okay thank you. Okay so we are 1 minute over, any other questions team? Hello guys sorry for joining late I show. Himanshu you will get a . Get a punishment Okay. So the stand up uh okay let's you have 10 minutes more so we were you have any quick updates on the in-review. Because I believe team has lot of questions which we would be discussing in the sync up call but if you have when we have to talk about yeah the board related stories. Can you please update on these?which are in in-review. . Yeah so this one uh the first one hive 22 so I guess the team needs to uh start committing their code in the branches and uh if they are successfully able to commit it, then this can be done. This can be moved into done. If they are facing any issues then we'll see how what can be solved and so this in-review is pending from the team's side. Well this rev.ai vocabulary, so avinash have you added all your scripts and everything as attachments in this user story? . No I will add today by like after this call I will add.. Yeah because unless and until you don't I mean you add then only I can put it to done so. Yeah. Okay I will add yeah. Just one thing here.. Uh Sravanthi and Himanshu, uh ok so uh himanshu is the product owner right?. Put it in done. Yeah. Can i. make me somebody like a product manager or something because I want to have a look at a demo before it goes to. Okay.. Because uh what I believe is you know there are all some gaps here you don't have to put my name here maybe I will just add himanshu in the shadow himanshu in this. Uh you may not have to make formal. See, in the call also came a very small small understanding gaps here and there. So it may happen individually the modules are working well but together there are some tweaks.. meaning to be done uh to to cover for those gaps that's why an end to end demo if we can do before we move to done. Review means the demo has to happen like, in my previous company product manager used to see the demo before doing done. . Okay. Okay so that means, uh, for each, uh, particular user story, we need to see, uh, what, how exactly the things are going on in that. And if you are satisfied, then we can move it on to done right?. Correct so see what I understand is like in my previous company I was a product owner or product. My job is to see on the done. Because the way we were working there was a safe agile that's why I'm just sharing my thought because I don't know here, it will be a conflict. So we used to uh do safe agile epics, which means after sprint is done an end to end demo should work well. Because it's kind of that version, all the epics should be complete, it should not be half done. If that end to end demo is not working . That means something is missing, then again. In the next sprint at the end there should be an end to end review . Layer by layer identically we're spending. Does it make sense?. So uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah so . Uh if I understand correctly like . Himanshu said if we have to go story by story. Uh so we do have a review before closing the whole sprint. We have a in-review and then so this is a story review which we are talking about.. about uh not the sprint review.. So we have separate yeah. This is just a story in which himanshu would be giving a feedback to the team, if they are missing something. Okay then i. It is not the sprint review, so we'll be having. having a sprint review before we close the whole sprint we're not  keeping the sprint 0 we're not completing the sprint here. okay and at that time there will be an end to end demo. Yes. Yes yes so once the correct. So once the stories to done.  then we have an end to end review, end to end, sprint review call with I would be suggesting where I mean setting up there uh himanshu as a product manager or a product owner, he would be explaining what what has been done throughout the sprint 0. oh. and then we'll be closing the sprint.. Got it, then makes sense, I misunderstood.. Yeah. This is only for a team to understand how they are doing in the story-wise. Okay. Yeah okay. Uh fine so we have only 5 minutes left to join the other call team, any other thing?. you would like to discuss here?. Yes uh himanshu, uh I'm not seeing any branches in the hive project.. the same bitbucket right? Yes yes. Okay so let's discuss that in the sync up call then. Yeah, okay.. Okay fine, ok team then let's meet at next 5, 4 minutes thank you for joining the call. Have a nice day.. Thank you thank you Sravanthi. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Bye. Uh when you start the other meeting. Can you call me? Sure, sure,okay, yeah thanks, . Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Sravanthi, yeah bye. Rest of the team say something. Good to hear. Thank you Sravanthi and Kajari.. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you bye bye",Meeting speaks about the different user stories of Sprint Hive 0 where team gives updates and discusses on their dependencies and to-do action plan for their future.
"Uh hi everyone, so am I audible?. Yes amit you can go ahead. Okay so. Yeah . I was working on uh hive 81 that I'm working simultaneously on both hive 108 and 109. I guess today it would be moved to testing. I have written the code actually and I am I will move it to testing today. Okay. That's it from my side.. So you'll be closing the related tasks also right?Yes, yes I'll do. Okay and kindly update the uh artifacts as well, the documents. . Whatever observations you have. Okay.. The story would due date is showng as 26th and good that you're you'll be I hope it is not uh beyond the due date.thank you. Yes. Hi everyone, this is avinash, uh regarding my user story which is API stitching. I have integrated a sentiment classifier. The only thing remaining is deadline escalation which I will do today so and then after Amit gives me API I will integrate that as well.. Hi Avinash, did you apply it on the scrum thing?. No no no. So there are 4 scrum calls which should I take?. Okay so sarika do you remember which one you worked on? Do you have the time stamp for that?. Yeah yesterday I have submitted a document to Avinash with the scrum link and what all content it has so anything else you are expecting from me?. Avinash, I mean will it be useful? Yeah yeah. She's she has done 4 uh meetings. No first one okay so okay okay I'll do that yeah first one is 18 January scrum meeting. Yes yes that one. Okay okay I will apply. Okay yeah. Hi everyone, this is Divesh. My user story is hive 92, I just completed the user story I mentioned in comments as well and the remaining part is I need to combine my code with hrisheek code as well , for message file is correctly successful or not, that we'll do by end of the dsy today.. Hi all this is Dhanuj, regarding my user story. Hey hey . sorry dhanuj I was talking on mute. Yeah so divesh uh I have one quick question to you so you were talking about 92 only right?. Yes. So you said there is something. more to do on this story or is it anything else?. No in the same story like we just, oh the ownership is lying on somebody else. Okay okay. The same story?. No it's different story actually we have it's of anuj. One second yeah. One second yeah divesh. So it is not a story uh Sravanthi it is just whatever he and hrisheek has done and whatever uh hrisheek has done they just need to make it together. So it is not I mean their task is done. It is just something they need to combine and send it to me. So that later we can have uh routes created. Okay. Okay understood. Thank you. Fine dhanuj go ahead please. go ahead please. Yeah. Hive 110 and hive 111 are like completed uh and hive 112 is also completed for one colour yesterday I modified the course.. in such a way that like it would be easy to add uh multiple colors in future. So for now it is enough to show one colour na himanshu sir, yes uh . Yes uh for now it's uh so when is your last date? 5 days means today only right? Yeah today only yeah yeah yeah so no time for research so yeah you can close this you check it again and you close this. Okay sir yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah Bhanu here uh hive 86 audio snippet logic uh almost development is done, just I moved to testing, just now uh later in this day I'll move to in-review once. So It will be done today? Today is the last day. Yeah it's done already. Okay so it needs to be moved to in-review. Hope you have attached the relevant documents so supporting ones. Yeah. Yeah hi this is hrisheek. Yeah yeah so that's file type validation and catching errors so this is done actually you can move it to like in-review because like the code the error message code is uh integrated with divesh only that the success score is it be done. But, as a part of the story only error score is there in this story, so the success measures it's like bit uh like uh addition to that so that is done. so that will be done by today. . So hrisheek if it's going to take uh more time then don't do it, you just finish it and uh you integrate it with divesh code but if you feel that it can be done along with the integration divesh then you can proceed yeah. the error code one is integrated sir actually the yeah the , the error message yeah yeah . So that story can be moved to in-review yeah Sravanthi. So only if you have time then only you do this success part otherwise you skip that okay?. Yeah yes sir okay mostly that will also be done sir no issues . Perfect perfect So uh. A quick question to himanshu when are we moving all of these I think these these, you will be working with the team right? This UI UX one? So.. So this will be moved tomorrow I guess because today is the last day so tomorrow we'll add okay. So it will be completed right? By the due date mentioned. Yes atleast by 3rd.. Yes I mean due date means yeah 3rd 3rd yes. 3rd will be the due date . Okay . Hi this is Avijit. Yeah last day dhanuj and bhanu sent their codes, changed my.I have uh Inserted my logic on their code and there was some issue like the orientation of transcript was getting changed so I changed my entire thing and now it is coming fine. I would like to show that in the sync up. Okay so i have attached the screenshots it can be moved to in-review i think. . Any questions to him, himanshu? I'm moving it to in-review.. Yeah yeah move it I have no questions I have seen it. It was just merging of the codes I guess he has done it. Okay. Yeah hi anuj this side. Uh so regarding this I have like uh customise the code with the keys. So, the help with help of avijit yesterday soit's done you can move it to testig or tested I have to attache the documents still. Also sir has to see it's right I mean. Correct correct so we'll connect on this in sync up . Hi Sravanthi, Suresh here. So actually my 82 task is completed so I'll be check with himanshu this 91 so what I need to implement so then the sync up call . I'll discuss with him. Okay thank you. Yes . so sarika and nikita? Yes hi everyone so I have submitted both the transcripts of the week to sarika meeting 5 and meeting 4. Nikita your voice is very  low. Yeah is it audible now? .  Yeah is it audible now? Yeah it was but it was very low. Yeah so i. yeah please continue. Yes so I submitted . First and second and she has to do the latter part and uh the user story nam uh, could we change it?. So yeah Nikita you said to change the user story name. we will do that. So there was a lot of background noise. So that's the reason I asked you to go on mute. Okay anythint else from Nikita? I think you can pink Nikita. So sarika? Coming to I recevied the two scripts Sravanthi, yesterday and today. So ill be working on labeling the script and uh yeah. Okay fine so everything is okay right? Are you people facing any problem in getting the recordings or anything?. No uh one question Sravanthi, I just had ato understand is when you click on my uh name and we have a meeting file labeling in to do and meeting 4 labeling in done. When you observe my page, right so my question here is when you click on the Nikita's name there is a meeting 4 labeling and meeting 5 labeling still in meeting 4 transcription and 5 in . In this here either in to do or in-progress. So may question is . Until and unless I received a transcription, I cannot do the labeling right? So I think meeting 4 transcription here in the progress should be like in done I guess we have to move it. So that is. No no no I'll tell you what. No no no I'll tell you what. So this meeting transcription 4, this has a complete transcription half of your task and half od nikita's task. So this particular thing I think this should be moved, yeah that is what I am I meant it, one second. Oh no no I'll tell. I'm sorry I'm confusing you and I'm getting confused. So each week you are supposed to do 2scripts right? So in the 2 scripts instead of writing 8 I mean 2 each 2 2 that will be that should be coming up to 4 stories right. Instead of making 4 stories we have enhanced the story limit story points. Earlier it was 3, now it is 5. So Nikita can whatever Nikita is doing, the 2nd story, that will be updated here  only and meeting 5 will be having 2 sripts again. So that's the reason if you're completed you're story part here that means this complete labeling is done and okay my question is okay so hmm. so this label as per your . discussion I mean just a wordmy doubt is like meeting 4 labeling will have 2 scripts. Meeting 5 labeling. Yes. Will have 2 scripts. Correct. So in that case in meeting 4 labeling. I have uploaded only one script.. Right. So actually this cannot be moved to done. It should be in in-progress. Hmm yeah. That's the reason just the story points is showing as 5. So the other day we were discussing in the same thing. Instead of having 4 user stories on each of you. Right. we thought 2 stories and we'll increase the story points. Because we have already started the sprint and if we start adding stories more it will be a scope change after the sprint is started, So that's the reason we have changed the story points.  So you are saying whatever a script, you are, the second script, which you are supposed to do, that should be coming into meeting 4 labeling . Okay so where, is there a option to upload another document? . So uh so what we can do is we I'll just check if we can move it back to in-progress hmm I'll just check and let you know. Now that I think Nikita had submitted two scripts right? Right the second. the second one will go here, for review or else to done. Yeah, the second one after you do this second one this story will be moving to done. Yeah sure. Only one you have done and it is moved to done no. No it should be having the 2nd script also in this. Yeah true but my, I'll let you know if we can just move it. right back and then you can attach the complete thing here. the second script as well. Okay if there is an option.. Can we uh upload the document in the standard option. There there we have a two thing, one is a PHI PHI. and the standard so for uploading the document, can I use the same standard option there? For a second script. Yes you can. Okay. You can okay . Yeah that is that is my story . No problem I understood sorry to confuse you girls. Yeah no problem, thank you. So anything else, team? Okay I'll take the silence as No ok then let's join at 3:20 call and get your doubts clarifies. Thank you thank you Sravanthi. Okay thank you bye bye bye Thank you Sravanthi and team bye bye ","Meeting speaks about team's update on the progress of individual user stories, Transcription and Labelling workflow user story creation format clarified."
"Stories are moved to in-review and uh 3,4 most of them are in done status. So uh are we good to . Move it to done himanshu? You were saying that you were waiting for couple of things to move the stories to done. Yes so today I moved a lot of stories to done, there are 2 stories on Anuj's name. So anuj you have given me the link of uh local git uh sorry collab code Yes yes I'll just push the code . Push the code into bitbucket and send you yeah . Send me the link and then I will put it to done so 2 stories on his name and 1 is on Avijit's name. so I guess he's facing. Some technical issues on bitbucket, so in the sync up call I will just sort it out and then that can also be put in done okay and then after bhanu's we have bhanu's uh extraction of names uh yeah bhanuj just yes uh I just wanted to know one last update from him so bhanuj.  .  I just wanted to know one last update from him so Dhanuj, it's done right? Yeah yeah it's done complete. Yeah perfect so I'll move it and same goes with Dhanuj dhanuj also so he showed me the code so that is the code that you have committed dhanuj.. I haven't committed yet so I have to divide it into functions for . once you are done today by today afternoon. today by today afternoon. I will be doing that I will be completing perfect so. perfect so once you're done with that I'll just move you just attach the link and I will move yeah it to done okay sir  . okay. Okay. Then we have two more stories that are in in progress. okay.  So I guess anuj now you will have to start the work for putting the code uh but the code function what yeah. yeah. For the two codes  So I think I have already, I'll show you, the code. You'll see, you'll see the code and you can let me know if its already converted into functions, modules and classes because I have like separated the codes. For the hey okay And, uh, so I guess one more person was there in this Epic, right. I guess Bhanu or dhanuj uh anuj sravanthi if you can come down and the in review part in review in review one second. Yeah. Label extraction on bhanu Uh, bhanu's name little bit more up. Yeah,  And this is on anuj's name on it. so only, you will have to see a bhanuj code you and bhanu also, uh, sorry. So sorry. you and bhanu also sit and uh  make sure that the code is in The right format and integrated,  Uh, together. And then once the integration is done, so everything should be  in one single pattern file Okay. so Bhanu code and your code should be in one single or one second. It is  code. And, it can be in python file and then in a form of functions so that we can call those functions and we can get the results. okay. um okay and  Yes. Uh, you asked me that, uh, since your code is similar to the code of, uh, Divesh,  dhanuj and hrisheek So it should be put in the topic extraction, but, uh, even though you are right, but no, we should, uh, keep it in label extraction only because that is part of that particular Epic.only So push it in that a label extraction only okay?. uh okay. Okay.  . next and then avinash we have uh Yes, sir Uh, regarding vocabulary, uh, now I'm using a tf-idf to generate, uh, vocabulary and that will go into the custom vocabulary  rev.ai So that is done. And also one more thing. There are some sentences in the after diarization there is some overlap between  consecutive audio data, diarized audio chunks So I've removed that, uh, regarding, uh, error correction model. I'm working by Monday  i will let you know. So make Monday as your last date okay So if you are able to do that, it's okay if not then already, we have got a good achievements, so you can just commit the . The final goal code and that okay will be done okay. okay Yes, yes, yes.. so Uh, one quick question here. So whatever we have defined in this particular story, are we achieving it hundred percent or is there any leftout thing?  what do you what do you say himanshu, how is it done?. Yeah, screened output transcript it is, uh, the machine learning thing. So we can never say Machine Learning output has hundred per cent. okay so We have to pull the threshold that okay. if it has crossed this threshold then that means we are  good to go okay so as the time is less. So we have decided that 40% of the transcript cleanup is good. So anuj uh sorry. Avinash has already achieved 40% accuracy, but since sprint has a few more days, I've asked them that take two more days of time. And by Monday if we get more accuracy. It's good. Otherwise, 40 percent is also good. Okay so so. I don't know. Maybe it's the wrong one or correct one. Do we have the,  similar thing for this sprint one also? Or is it done here? similar sort of a story. No no. It will be done here it is done okay okay . after the demo then we will see when oh kajari says we can work on more detailed machine learning models, then we can again, come back and create.. some more stories on this part.Okay. Okay clear understood thank you. So by Monday, can I expect all the stories. all these stories in done status ? or or these two, except these two ?. no, no everything will be done. So I guess, uh, today, uh, anuj's will be in done and Avinash,  will be will be In done on Monday, yeah.. On Monday,Monday it will be in done. So today it will be in all three stages tested testing, and, uh, and in review. you will be doing all the today?. actually himanshu has tested, he's saying that, uh, like accuracy. is very low. That means they have less okay data and less time, so it's tested, but, iam, in improving i'm working on, yeah actually getting more accuracy Yeah, . uh testing as of now we can keep it in testing yeah. That's my question. So do we have to set in testing or what? Okay. Yeah, testing yeah yeah Okay. Fine. Okay. I just moved it to testing and I hope you are uploading. I mean, attaching all the relevant artifacts to the stories. Yes. Yes, I have just okay yes.  So everyone is and adding okay only last thing. Okay From anuj's side pending commiting the code otherwise everything is perfect Okay.. Okay, great. Good, good to know. And and also this story, is it in, in progress only,it should be or. Yeah, it should be in-progress only because anuj not only have to convert his code, but also he has to sit with bhanu and, both okay of them have to come single file where everything can be put okay. Fine.. okay that was a quick one since all the stories. that are moved to in review and then done. So any other things or questions you may have regarding the board or  any other?. other topic you would like to say as a place holder?. Are there any impediments, are you dependent or any other stuff here?. i don't think there will be, as of now, maybe once anuj and Bhanu sit together and they say that something is pending otherwise, I don't think there will be an issue. So I had one question to ask, suresh I mean is your uh Request approved suresh? for the tools that you required?. uh hi himanshu so, still they didn't approve, but, uh, I have gone through that, uh, website. So what, uh, Kajari has given that, right. So I have, like, I did some R&D on that today. Also I'll continue then. Meanwhile, I'll get it from your, uh, previous what we have in the front end. Right. UI so that also I'll go through, once you are provided the credential, then I can first start probably right.. sorry? yeah.Thanks for Thanks for Yeah,so avinash yeah, yeah,himanshu We have that docker right? which uh ashutosh and sushmita created for the UI ?. Yes, sir. Uh, I mean, Docker file is there, we need to create an image and then we need to run Yeah.. yeah so whenever you have free time you can open it yeah okay okay I will yes. Yeah. Okay. okay I will yes, I will create the content. Yeah, sure. Fine with that. Um, then I can start, uh, once it's get, and then I can start probably Monday something. I'll start on that. Yeah.. yeah.and please make sure that you keep on pinging ankur and Kajari so that the approval gets fast Yeah.. so that the approval gets fast Yeah. Yeah. I already i have it a word with kajari. Yeah I have a word with Kajari So it might be will get it soon. Yeah, yeah because after once the sprint, when sprint 1 starts  I guess most probably then only.your wireframe yeah design will yeah also start  We have to develop it as well and a lot of time will go in, uh, the UI development that is for sure. so Yeah.Yeah. for the POC demo, that's where I'm doubtful that we will be able to give them a demo of UI uh,  uh, stipulated time so let's see . Yeah. sure. Fine. Yeah. So, uh, one quick.. Question here himanshu so is it the only, I mean, the one which uh suresh. has been requesting for approval. So that that's mandatory thing for this UI thing. Or do we have any others? The and all the mandatory things? . yes So, whatever.oh okay suresh requires they are all paid tools. Yes.yes so I saw I Yeah, that's the reason it is taking long time . Yes. Yes. that's why otherwise it was a free tool he would have.. started right away. correct Correct.  Okay. So do I, my question is, do we have any alternative for that?. I don't think for the timings so for the timing uh, for the timing we, has to just a mock up created for that, but, uh, the tools is mandatory. Then only the, whenever we ask to give him for back end developers, then only they can understand the exact scenario. okay. Yeah. Okay. Fine. Uh, I don't know why. But, uh, uh, sorry sarika is saying that. She's not having any link to join the call. So I just pinged her the link. I maybe they, the invite is extended to them, right? The stand up call.  Yes. Oh, she's saying this. I have no link . I have no link so I couldn't join it . okay. So any other things that the team would like to talk here? are we good to close the stand up.? I think there are no questions Not good to close stand up. Shall we continue?. Nothing from my side sravanthi okay. okay. That's nice. Side Yeah. Okay then. Yeah. Thanks. Thank you guys for, um, confirming and one more thing in the daily SyncUP call. Do you need me? I mean, is there any, anything for me?. to talk there?. it will be a technical thing as himanshu said it would be showing something there. So you guys can yeah carry on with that? Yeah. . yeah, it can. be optional for you yes . Yes. And, uh, sarika I think, sorry,sarika joined the call. sarika you have anything to say? in our daily. Stand up. You have any updates from your end. ?. hey Hi, sravanthi I'm so sorry. I joined late, no problem I'll uh so from my end, there is nothing else.. okay Okay, fine.You have anything then you can, um, probably join the SyncUP call. When you have anything to ask technical, any other stuff to talk. any other stuff to talk but, uh, you guys carry on with the. SyncUP call it's only 2 minutes left. Okay. Okay.sravanthi fine then yeah Thank you guys. Have a nice weekend. yeah Thanks a lot for joining. the call bye bye. Thank you.Thank you.Thank you sravanthi thank you bye","Meeting speaks about the user story updates, it's action items and on approval of UI tool for wireframe design and development"
"So here everything looks good anything is pending? Anyone who has to show I guess bhanu has worked on this part uh audio snippet bhanu can you show that once?. And even this is the one on the system uh this is the hmm yes avijit I put the JSON in that UI. So this is looking like this okay yeah have put some sample are nice awesome. Instead of that we'll just give this path to them correct okay. Correct okay so you will be showing this us today right?. I'll try to finish it off today. even if it, uh, you don't finish it off, you can just show this part, whatever condition is in, you can show it okay because this is our USP.

"the revised code in a zip format. I sent you already yeah. Perfect then I'll just integrate it all integrate all the codes today. Yeah. Dhanuj anything pending from your side? No himanshu no. so whatever you have done you have already shared with me. Yeah I have sent you, if you guys shared me on teams or mail? I shared teams you on teams teams okay yeah fine okay Avinash, anything pending from your side? not pending from my not pending anything but uh i need to check how much time it takes for different size of video files . Correct so so you have already done it for 2 meetings?. but those are uh 15 minutes, 10 minutes. meetings and those meeting took how much time?. 30 minutes approx 25-30 minutes. and everything included keyframes and yes. But, uh, the video,uh which I have uploaded is through postman's. So maybe it took long time. Now we are uploading through the website. Okay. . but anyways uploading is still going right ,Anyways it is going from local to server either through website or through so it will take time still. But uh uploading through website is taking less time than uploading through postman. Okay. Yeah so uploading through website. task is done, right. And it's getting uploaded. And a, as it is uploaded, it is starting the containers. Uh, speech man container? Hmm correct  And Once it is, once everything is done, are you sending any flag back so that the UI knows that everything is done and the buttons should be activated. yeah . right now I'm sending the oral JSON and and response of that meeting but definitely yeah. Yeah so we but we need to know. we need to know through the this thing so the UI that everything is. So maybe in the JSON that you are generating a can have a flag like ready. So if ready flag will be false still last JSON last uh component of JSON is uploaded at otherwise . Once everything is done then ready  becomes true. Okay So I need to add a key into that JSON ready ?. Yes at the starting maybe uh if ready is false that means is still it is getting generated if ready is true, that means now all the generation is done and then UI will know that yeah it's done.. Okay okay I will do that I understood I'll do that. Okay so now then if this is done so next let's come to divesh. Oh divesh and hrishee uh so I guess you guys are done with the upload part and everything and how about the pending task? So I mean which is coffee or something?. Yeah himanshu nothing. the upload file is almost done. So we are trying to some add some 75 components on the to beautify the upload page, with some gifs and some images. Like, Kajari said we need to add some graphic things on. Um, on the entire pipeline so currently we are doing now. by end of the day or tomorrow morning it will be done. Perfect so avinash you have that key so we have to think of a . of a scenario where like every minute or every five minutes, a request is sent to, uh, the Mongo DB, API which avinash has created for talking with mongo and it should and we should check that JSON if ready tag ready is false than the button should not be active, if ready is true then button should be active.. So who so . So that means you and hrisheek both are doing this task. Right? Yes himanshu yeah so what so then I will work on this logic. Okay so so. avinash by what time uh this is ready? Tag will be done?. I will add After this meeting is over. That means by evening, we will have it, right. Yeah yeah okay by evening we will have it. So I will send that request and it will give me true . will I test whether it is false or not. Um, then I will create, I will download that JSON and I will check for the false tags. Okay I'll have to create a loop. Fine fine so you just once you are done you let me know okay?. Let me know okay? So I have a doubt. So if you add a ready tag so you um what what are you doing? You calling API or mongo DB collection right?. Mongo DB I will be calling your API which talks with the mongo DB collection. Oh okay so if you call okay so which API you will call? Because thera re 7 or 8 API's. You gave me an API right. Which gives me the mongo DB JSON. Okay you created a okay. Yeah yeah I understood yeah sorry so that okay okay. Okay. Okay. Okay so Amit anything pending from your side? Yeah. Uh I guess a little bit of frontend is pending okay I have to talk to you regarding this we'll have a call. So I am outside so that's why I joined from mobile I will reach home by 2:30 so maybe after that I'll ping you and we'll connect okay?. yes definitely. got it so okay so uh anything else sarika nikita you guys want to add?. Hi himanshu yeah carry on Hi nikita . Sure sure carry on so I will be working on the same labeling of the script which I received so yeah today I'm blocked with that task today yeah um, Himanshu I'm beginning with the second script of a week so I'll be transcribing that today.. Okay yeah yeah suresh anything pending from your side I think everyone is done. Um, uh, I don't think so himanshu so actually that the last time Nikita had given that feedback icon no so that icon I need to add so that icon I can pass to Amit he can just had it. Okay perfect. Okay then anything else you guys want to share?. Wednesday is our demo so today by end of the day.  Most of the things from my side will be complete whatever is pending tomorrow I will integrate.
