Cool so at 3:30 I have meeting with Shilpa and sravanthi so at the same time you can also join and yeah you can have,"[[36, 42, 'Person Name'], [47, 56, 'Person Name']]"
"so today who's uh MoM writing, date was the 3rd person.","[[3, 8, 'Date']]"
After bhanu after bhanu it was me sir but uh I'm the 4th guy,"[[6, 11, 'Person Name'], [18, 23, 'Person Name']]"
4th 4th so who's uh I think anuj anuj was 2nd uh bhanu teja has did the 2nd position,"[[28, 32, 'Person Name'], [33, 37, 'Person Name'], [49, 59, 'Person Name']]"
"Okay. So that means that makes, anuj as 3rd but I think anuj has resigned from the organisation so I'm not sure whether","[[32, 36, 'Person Name'], [56, 60, 'Person Name']]"
How much he will be joining these sessions but anuj is here hi anuj,"[[47, 51, 'Person Name'], [63, 67, 'Person Name']]"
So  let me give you the work. So I guess today it's your turn to take the uh minutes of meeting,"[[41, 46, 'Date']]"
and pen that will be a little faster because this MoM is not for uh like general MoM so which we upload in confluence this is for the model training so,"[[107, 117, 'Tool']]"
"So, okay. So I'll repeat whatever I said before the recording. So avinash you have done for the first video, you have done the classification task as well. So now for the second video, you do the same thing. Uh, tell the classification and both the Excel sheets you can share So that will be the first task done. Then one second  let me share that, uh, um, that Excel sheet where I created the plan. One second.","[[66, 73, 'Person Name'], [249, 261, 'Tool'], [362, 373, 'Tool']]"
"So let's just start with Abinash. So, anyways, as of now we are following this uh particular table, but once the scrum and everything is done, then we will be following the exact scrum rules.","[[25, 32, 'Person Name'], [113, 118, 'Scrum'], [179, 190, 'Scrum']]"
"Getting assigned with uh, epics and a task is beside them and based on the sprint planning. We will continue. But for this week, uh, till uh, uh, sravanthi's completely onboarded into inside This project, maybe we'll have to continue with this particular table.  Okay so for avinash speaker diarisation is done with for for first video the second video you guys will generating now the next thing is spell checkers and summary clean up so actually spell checker is part of summary clean up only so avijit and avinash you both will be working on this so avijit","[[26, 31, 'Scrum'], [38, 42, 'Scrum'], [75, 90, 'Event'], [146, 157, 'Person Name'], [275, 282, 'Person Name'], [498, 504, 'Person Name'], [509, 516, 'Person Name'], [553, 559, 'Person Name']]"
I will be giving you the KT at 3:30 but still.,"[[25, 27, 'Event']]"
"You can parallely work with avinash yeah sure on the summary it's a normal NLP task. So you can, I mean, uh, for the first video you have the mom, the manual mom as well. as The generated transcript. So you will, you both will have to see what kind of error so avinash the same task, the red pointers that you had in the previous Excel sheet, same thing you will have to done you will have to do. And then you will have to come up. You both have to come up with a strategy, like how this can be automated, whether we have to create a custom dictionary, or uh, anything. So first you will have to compare both the transcripts and then come up with the strategies based on that. So once every avinash avinash you also shared, you shared it with the WhatsApp i mean sorry the team's group then i will also have a look at it i will also compare and maybe i'll also.","[[28, 35, 'Person Name'], [75, 78, 'Technologies'], [261, 268, 'Person Name'], [330, 341, 'Tool'], [691, 698, 'Person Name'], [699, 706, 'Person Name'], [747, 755, 'Tool'], [773, 779, 'Tool']]"

The team's group.,"[[4, 10, 'Tool']]"
"thing is amit and dhanuj. So text summarization, so you will be finding the actual transcript and you will be having the mom. So you will have to see what are the exact, uh, sentences in the generated transcript, which matches with the mom. And then based on that, you will have to summarize. So obviously the summarization will be the normal process which you have been doing using Pegasus or T5 after that you will have to see after the summarization, what are those important things and what are not? So you continue with the text summarization, and then after that you will be, uh, giving this summary to, uh, I guess, uh,hrisheek and divesh","[[9, 13, 'Person Name'], [18, 24, 'Person Name'], [626, 634, 'Person Name'], [639, 645, 'Person Name']]"

"topics extraction and, uh bhanu and, uh, anuj till anuj is in the team bhanu. Once anuj leaves the team and we don't have any replacement. And I guess bhanu will join, hrisheek and divesh and because intent extraction or topics extraction, they are almost same. The only thing is.","[[26, 31, 'Person Name'], [41, 45, 'Person Name'], [51, 55, 'Person Name'], [71, 76, 'Person Name'], [83, 87, 'Person Name'], [151, 156, 'Person Name'], [168, 176, 'Person Name'], [181, 187, 'Person Name']]"
"We already know that we will be classifying questions, exclamations and, uh, some special tasks like that, while topics extraction, like what is the theme on which we are talking about? So whether we are talking about workos, we are talking about Docker in that particular sentence. So like that you will have to extract those topics","[[218, 224, 'Technical Platform'], [247, 253, 'Technologies']]"
"Once the summary given by amit and dhanuj is received by hrisheek and divesh, You guys look at the look at each sentences and see what kind of topics are present there and based on that, you will have to extract those major topics. So suppose, suppose in the first meeting we discussed about, uh, uh, I guess bhanu asked the question that why handwritten mom is required. So then, uh, kajari explained and the entire thing. So with that, the topic extracted can be importance of mom, uh, importance of manual mom. So like that for every sentence or every paragraph that we are summarizing. First, we have to check whether there is an important topic or not. And if there is an important topic, what is the topic presented? And based on that, you will have to train the model. So as of now, obviously there is a lot of manual work as well, but then only we can train the model. So first look at the transcripts and come up with a strategy. So either you can use any NLP algorithm, or if you are feeling that NLP algorithm will not work, then you can create a rule based.algorithm","[[1007, 1010, 'Technologies'], [26, 30, 'Person Name'], [35, 41, 'Person Name'], [57, 65, 'Person Name'], [70, 76, 'Person Name'], [309, 314, 'Person Name'], [385, 391, 'Person Name'], [965, 968, 'Technologies']]"
"So if this term is present, then it is definitely talking about this particular topic. So like that you guys have to start then coming to Bhanu and anuj you guys have to extract those themes. So questions. So I guess I have added in my manual thing, I have added.","[[138, 143, 'Person Name'], [148, 152, 'Person Name']]"
"In the actual transcripts, there can be more questions. So don't only depend on what my, uh, manual transcript is saying. You also look at the actual transcript and see questions. Are there or not actions, discussions, obviously that is there. What is, what are the action items? What are the discussion item, questions, dates. So if there is a deadline that has to be, something has to be done before a deadline. So that can be one intent with the name deadline. So if there is an intent with the name deadline, then the deadline, which is the actual date that needs to be extracted as well, because later once you will click on the intent of deadline, then that sentence will come in the right-hand side. And then it will tell us  What is the actual date that will be extracted so like that if you look at the presentation which kajari has created on the left-hand side we have all the intents that is the task of bhanu and anuj while on the middle side there are all the what do we say let me share that particular thing as well so that it will become more clear so if you see here","[[812, 824, 'Tool'], [831, 837, 'Person Name'], [916, 921, 'Person Name'], [926, 930, 'Person Name']]"

 So I need to convert the code into a function. So in that function I need to extract the excel sheet and converts into a list and the list could be passes the main logic code. So I think it will be done by today or tomorrow morning,"[[207, 212, 'Date'], [216, 224, 'Date']]"

the story points!,"[[4, 16, 'Scrum']]"
"I think, No I think the basic code creation in that what we wanted and the way it has to be done, already the logic has been incorporated.Okay  So all he needs to do is convert it into a function. So I guess that will be done. Right Divesh?","[[233, 239, 'Person Name']]"
Yes Himanshu,"[[4, 12, 'Person Name']]"

So you just create some dummy sentences. You can just think of like, let's create, let's have a meeting tomorrow, if that is the case or like that you come up with five or 10 new sentences and then try to apply your logic there as well.

"HIVE 18. Okay ...So what I did was I took the misspelled words from all the standup calls, generated transcript, and I have added them to the custom vocabulary of rev.ai. So now it is generating the words like Pegasus exactly. pegasus is currently generated yes yes But the problem with rev.ai is that we cant add alphanumeric words. So T5, it should be T- FIVE","[[0, 7, 'Scrum'], [163, 169, 'Tool'], [287, 293, 'Tool']]"
Perfect.  So what you do today is you just add few more vocabularies to it whatever you can think of this based on our meeting. And then you just mark this task as done.,"[[25, 30, 'Date'], [156, 160, 'Scrum'], [164, 168, 'Status']]"
"Yeah, based on that. First, try it on first four and see if you can resolve on those issues or not. And then later, what do we say, Nikita and Sarika will be sending you more files and then you'll have to incorporate that as well. But as of now, let's just start with the first four and let's see if you can make a note. So you  can mark your comments in HIVE 18 and HIVE 14.

"okay, how to..ok So in this meeting we are only talking about scrum?","[[62, 67, 'Scrum']]"
"Yeah, we are talking kind of more about the scrum, but I guess today I'll research more about this model and see if we can finetune this model so that it will have the vocabulary of workOS and Anthem.","[[44, 49, 'Scrum'], [63, 68, 'Date'], [182, 188, 'Technical Platform']]"
"So before fine tuning your try, like you have given the entire, uh, minutes of the meeting, right. Maybe you break the minutes of meeting into four parts and then see if you're getting four lines. Like what kind of summary you are getting for four lines on what kind of, yeah. What kind of summary you are getting for four lines? Four paragraphs, sorry, because as of now, I mean, yeah, so then we will get four lines and then we can say that, okay this is the overall summary. Why I'm not going to finetune because we are, we are having lack of time. And also for this particular POC phase, Kajari wants to avoid any kind of fine tuning or custom tuning. So that is why, uh, whatever is the output. It's good. It is talking about scrum. So it is giving us the output.The next thing that you can do is you can just break, your paragraphs and break your sentence into four paragraphs and see if you're getting four different summaries, which you can combine. And that will be the overall summary. That that is the last thing that you can do. And then after that, you move on to your next user story.  Okay? Okay..Right so Please write your comments in your ,by the end of the day please write your comments in the user story.","[[592, 598, 'Person Name'], [731, 736, 'Scrum'], [1087, 1097, 'Scrum'], [1213, 1223, 'Scrum']]"

Yeah. So I guess tomorrow Kajari has scheduled a call.,"[[26, 32, 'Person Name'], [17, 25, 'Date']]"
"Just because myself Shilpa and Suresh, we have recently joined, so feel free to join that call, um, to have more insights if you are missing any, the team.  Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah ummthat's all and Himanshu you have anything from your end?","[[20, 26, 'Person Name'], [31, 37, 'Person Name'], [198, 206, 'Person Name']]"
"Team ! You have anything to ask to Himanshu, this is the right forum!","[[35, 43, 'Person Name']]"
"First I'll go. So it's about the, Bigbucket thing which I mentioned in the group in the morning. So I have created a Bitbucket. Actually, it was created a long time back, but we were not using it only, I guess Avinash and Anuj and Divesh, they only used it, Hrisheek but after that we stopped using it, but now we have to use it aggressively. So as, as I told in the group, uh, we have to create our own, branch , sometime so I am sharing my screen for sometime. Yeah. Yeah. So like in the topics extraction Bhanu and Divesh and  Hrisheek are working. So any one of you guys can create this branch, uh, from your terminal and then you put your good inside this. So how to put your code. As of now, you can proceed like this, source/ML/Divesh, and inside that Divesh's code.  So similarily, Hrisheek inside that Hrisheek code and like that source/ML/Bhanu and inside that Bhanus's code  for topics extraction, same goes with Label extraction, filters, video analysis, and like that for all the eight epics I have, uh, you have to create eight different feature branches. Now Uh, where is it, once one epic is done once topic extraction is done, then the last three user story is first conversion of your code and giving it a structure, right. And converting it into an API, then generating a standardized, JSON, and then finally storing it into Mongo DB. That means these three things require merging of work of Divesh, Hrisheek and Bhanu for topic extraction. So once this merge is done, once this API has been created and once the Mongo DB storage script has also been written. That means we have all the three things ready, Divesh code, Hrishhek code, Bhanu code, all  integrated, that should be kepy inside src/ml/final, that will be the final code, that will go, so later in the develop branch I will only look at the final section. Okay? This will be the onlyone only code i will be taking and putting into develop. So develop means we are starting the stitching of all these epics. Once all these epics are done, we will start stitching it. That will go in develop branch. Once everything is working perfectly in develop branch we will put it in the master branch. Now master branch is called the main branch. So we will put it in the main branch. So that will e the final code that we will be showing for Demos and later we are going to follow the same process. May be in future we are going to change this kind of structure, but as of now till this POC goes we will be following this structure. So I hope everyone is well versed with how to use github and bigbucket is nothing but github only,  it is given by aclasean. So those who dont know or have little, i am only talking about the development team, so those who dont know just go through an article, watch a video and then just learn how exactly pull push, creation of branches, everything is being done using terminal. So if you guys have any question just let me know.","[[34, 43, 'Tool'], [117, 126, 'Tool'], [210, 217, 'Person Name'], [222, 226, 'Person Name'], [231, 237, 'Person Name'], [258, 266, 'Person Name'], [508, 513, 'Person Name'], [518, 524, 'Person Name'], [530, 538, 'Person Name'], [735, 741, 'Person Name'], [759, 767, 'Person Name'], [790, 798, 'Person Name'], [811, 819, 'Person Name'], [849, 854, 'Person Name'], [871, 879, 'Person Name'], [999, 1004, 'Scrum'], [1100, 1104, 'Scrum'], [1164, 1174, 'Scrum'], [1344, 1352, 'Technologies'], [1411, 1417, 'Person Name'], [1419, 1427, 'Person Name'], [1432, 1437, 'Person Name'], [1532, 1540, 'Technologies'], [1626, 1632, 'Person Name'], [1639, 1647, 'Person Name'], [1654, 1659, 'Person Name'], [1981, 1986, 'Scrum'], [2003, 2008, 'Scrum'], [2013, 2017, 'Status'], [2553, 2559, 'Tool'], [2564, 2573, 'Tool'], [2589, 2595, 'Tool'], [2618, 2626, 'Tool']]"

"these, the one which you have mentioned  instead of stories. Right?","[[52, 59, 'Scrum']]"
"Yeah. So Sravanthi the last user story that they will be doing, that user story will not be closed until and unless they're code, any user story will not be closed until and unless their code is inside the Bitbucket. So that is the rule. So no need to create a new task, the user story, any user story supposed Divesh user's story, it will be closed only once the code is complete, code is committed and reviewed by me based on the, uh, Sonar Lint or any kind of Lint correction tools. And if it passes that test, then only the user story will be closed. Otherwise it will again, come back to the developer to rectify the issue.","[[9, 18, 'Person Name'], [28, 38, 'Scrum'], [69, 79, 'Scrum'], [92, 98, 'Status'], [134, 144, 'Scrum'], [157, 163, 'Status'], [206, 215, 'Tool'], [261, 269, 'Scrum'], [275, 285, 'Scrum'], [291, 301, 'Scrum'], [311, 317, 'Person Name'], [318, 330, 'Scrum'], [343, 349, 'Status'], [372, 380, 'Status'], [528, 538, 'Scrum'], [547, 553, 'Status'], [404, 412, 'Status']]"

"these are the minimal tasks that, that is helping the, that would be going as a part of user story.","[[22, 27, 'Scrum'], [88, 98, 'Scrum']]"
Right. So these are the tasks extra tasks.,"[[24, 29, 'Scrum'], [36, 41, 'Scrum']]"
"these are the tasks, extra tasks, even though they are saying that whatever updates they have given that goes according to the users story heading","[[14, 19, 'Scrum'], [27, 32, 'Scrum'], [76, 83, 'Status'], [127, 138, 'Scrum']]"

So I will take this responsibility then. So let them work on their own user story. I  will create an user story on my name and I will create all these branches so that it will not effect them. So once these branches are created you guys can start pushing your codes,"[[71, 81, 'Scrum'], [101, 111, 'Scrum']]"
"Right, So once I am done with that I will ping in the group and then you guys can start pushing it. Right And make an habbit of pushing the code. Because if you are not pushing your code and your system gets some issue, then entire effort is gone. And also when you are working on the server which is suppose AWS, then either you have to use WINSCP or Cyberduck to send your data from your system to AWS, but instead of that if your entire code is in Bigbucket, then all you have to do is GIT Clone, and then that will be a super fast process and that will also help in future CI-CD pipeline making, so always make an habbit, whatever code you write, working code, even though it has some kind of errors just keep on pushing it. Okay? As of now we are in the R&D phase. But whatever you put in that is being very closely monitored by the ANTHEM team. ANd then that code passes two kind of test, one is the Blue Optima test and second is the Sonar Cube test. And if you guys are failing in those tests, then it affects your appraisal and multiple other things. So as of now we are in the starting phase, so that Blue Optima and Sonar Qube will not come. But after the march POC and Demo, once we get the funding and once we get the anthem managers assigned and multiple other things, then all these things will come into picture. So we are three months, so it is better to follow these habbits.

So the stand up uh okay let's you have 10 minutes more so we were you have any quick updates on the in-review.

Can you please update on these?which are in in-review.,"[[44, 53, 'Status'], [15, 21, 'Scrum']]"
"Yeah so this one uh the first one hive 22 so I guess the team needs to uh start comitting their code in the branches and uh if they are successfully able to commit it, then this can be done. This can be moved into done. If they are facing any issues then we'll see how what can be solved and so this in-review is pending from the team's side.

No I will add today by like after this call I will add.,"[[14, 19, 'Date']]"
Yeah because unless and until you don't I mean you add then only I can put it to done so. Yeah. Okay I will add yeah,"[[81, 85, 'Status']]"
"Uh Sravanthi and Himanshu, uh ok so uh himanshu is the product owner right?","[[3, 12, 'Person Name'], [17, 25, 'Person Name'], [39, 47, 'Person Name']]"
"Because uh what I believe is you know there are all some gaps here you don't have to put my name here maybe I will just add himanshu in the shadow himanshu in this. Uh you may not have to make formal. See, in the call also came a very small small understanding gaps here and there. So it may happen individually the modules are working well but together there are some tweaks.","[[124, 132, 'Person Name'], [147, 155, 'Person Name']]"
meaning to be done uh to to cover for those gaps that's why an end to end demo if we can do before we move to done,"[[107, 114, 'Status']]"
"Okay so that means, uh, for each, uh, particular user story, we need to see, uh, what, how exactly the things are going on in that. And if you are satisfied, then we can move it on to done right?","[[49, 59, 'Scrum']]"
"Correct so see what I understand is like in my previous company I was a product owner or product. My job is to see on the done. Because the way we were working there was a safe agile that's why I'm just sharing my thought because I don't know here, it will be a conflict. So we used to uh do safe agile epics, which means after sprint is done an end to end demo should work well. Because it's kind of that version, all the epics should be complete, it should not be half done.

In the next sprint at the end there should be an end to end review . Layer by layer identically we're spending. Does it make sense?,"[[12, 18, 'Status']]"
Himanshu said if we have to go story by story. Uh so we do have a review before closing the whole sprint. We have a in-review and then so this is a story review which we are talking about.,"[[0, 8, 'Person Name'], [31, 36, 'Scrum'], [40, 45, 'Scrum'], [98, 104, 'Status'], [116, 125, 'Status'], [148, 153, 'Scrum']]"
about uh not the sprint review.,"[[17, 23, 'Scrum']]"
"This is just a story in which himanshu would be giving a feedback to the team, if they are missing something. Okay then i. It is not the sprint review, so we'll be having","[[15, 20, 'Scrum'], [30, 38, 'Person Name'], [137, 143, 'Scrum']]"
having a sprint review before we close the whole sprint we're not  keeping the sprint 0 we're not completing the sprint here,"[[9, 15, 'Scrum'], [49, 55, 'Scrum'], [79, 87, 'Scrum'], [113, 119, 'Scrum']]"

" then we have an end to end review, end to end, sprint review call with I would be suggesting where I mean setting up there uh himanshu as a product manager or a product owner, he would be explaining what what has been done throughout the sprint 0. oh. and then we'll be closing the sprint.","[[48, 54, 'Scrum'], [127, 135, 'Person Name'], [239, 247, 'Scrum'], [271, 278, 'Status'], [283, 289, 'Scrum']]"

whatever you want with the comment. Okay? Sure.,"[[27, 34, 'Scrum']]"
"Sure himanshu. Even though the function is almost same, but you guys are able to extract tools and whatever is your individual user story using that function right? Yes .

Yeah yeah yeah sure no issues I mean you can go slow no issues. Okay fine so yeah I have another question. So I think uhit's opt to ask me in sync up call or do I uh actually what happened is I had a call or chat with Kajari yesterday so she said like for a demo we want 3 samples. I mean to say there should be 3 samples for final demo right?,"[[142, 154, 'Event'], [218, 224, 'Person Name'], [225, 234, 'Date'], [326, 336, 'Event']]"
So like uh we will yesterday also we had a scrum meeting sorry we had a sync up call right? Right yeah,"[[19, 28, 'Date'], [43, 56, 'Event'], [72, 84, 'Event']]"
"That engineering meeting and today also we'll have a sync up call, so that can be engineering because there we are only discussing about engineering.","[[29, 34, 'Date'], [5, 24, 'Event'], [53, 65, 'Event']]"
Machine learning stuffs here we are discussing about scrum meetings,"[[53, 67, 'Event']]"
"Himanshu here. No as of now like uh uh 1 is engineering, and 1 is scrum right? What what is another one as Kajari said","[[0, 8, 'Person Name'], [107, 113, 'Person Name']]"
three samples. One is business meetings. Okay the one which uh yesterday the ADP one is a business I guess,"[[22, 39, 'Event'], [63, 72, 'Date'], [77, 80, 'Anthem Tools']]"
"Yeah that can be a business and you remember, you guys worked on 4 JAM meetings. Yeah.so those can be also business meetings. So we do have the transcript for it we just need to create a manual transcript and then we can give it to you and that will be the business transcript.","[[67, 79, 'Event'], [107, 124, 'Event']]"
"Okay okay. So I think I got a ADP uh thing from Kajari only so I can make use of it  Like for the instead of jam, I meant that in of jam sessions, we could make an ADP.","[[30, 33, 'Anthem Tools'], [48, 54, 'Person Name'], [133, 145, 'Event'], [164, 167, 'Anthem Tools']]"
Definitely so we can start with ADP and later if we need more data we can go with JAM also,"[[32, 35, 'Anthem Tools']]"
yeah that's it from my end himansh. Perfect so for the sake of,"[[27, 34, 'Person Name']]"
"for the sake of engineering,  for the sake of separate engineering meeting and separate transcript generation let's connect in a sync up call and let's discuss because I guess for the dhanuj uh code we have to discuss few things and avijit wanted to show something, so let's connect on it on the sync up call okay?","[[129, 141, 'Event'], [184, 190, 'Person Name'], [233, 239, 'Person Name'], [296, 308, 'Event']]"

Push the code into bitbucket and send you yeah,"[[19, 28, 'Technical Platform']]"
Send me the link and then I will put it to done so 2 stories on his name and 1 is on Avijit's name. so I guess he's facing,"[[53, 60, 'Person Name'], [85, 93, 'Person Name']]"
"Some technical issues on bitbucket, so in the sync up call I will just sort it out and then that can also be put in done okay and then after bhanu's we have bhanu's uh extraction of names uh yeah bhanuj just yes uh I just wanted to know one last update from him so bhanuj","[[25, 34, 'Technical Platform'], [141, 148, 'Person Name'], [157, 164, 'Person Name']]"
"I just wanted to know one last update from him so bhanuj, it's done right? Yeah yeah it's done complete. Yeah perfect so I'll move it and sams goes with Dhanuj dhanuj also so he showed me the code so that is the code that you have committed dhanuj?","[[90, 94, 'Status'], [153, 159, 'Person Name'], [95, 103, 'Status'], [241, 247, 'Person Name'], [160, 166, 'Person Name']]"

perfect so once you're done with that I'll just move you just attach the link and I will move yeah it to done okay sir,"[[105, 109, 'Status']]"
okay. Okay. Then we have two more stories that are in in progress,"[[34, 41, 'Scrum'], [54, 65, 'Status']]"
okay.  So I guess anuj now you will have to start the work for putting the code uh but the code function what yeah,"[[18, 22, 'Person Name']]"
"For the hey okay And, uh, so I guess one more person was there in this Epic, right. I guess Bhanu or dhanuj uh anuj sravanthi if you can come down and the in review part in review in review one second. Yeah. Legal extraction on bhanu Uh, bhanu's name little bit more up. Yeah,  And this is on anuj's name on it. so only, you will have to see a bhanuj code you and bhanu also, uh, sorry. So sorry. you and bhanu also sit and uh  make sure that the code is in The right format and integrated,  Uh, together.

And, uh, so yeah, it can be in, uh, uh,python file and then in a form of functions so that we can call those functions and we can get the results. okay. um okay and  Yes. Uh, you asked me that, uh, since your code is similar to the code of, uh, Divesh,  dhanuj and hrisheek So it should be put in the topic extraction, but, uh, even though you are right, but no, we should, uh, keep it in label extraction only because that is part of that particular Epic.only So push it in that a label extraction only okay?","[[92, 97, 'Person Name'], [101, 107, 'Person Name'], [111, 115, 'Person Name'], [116, 125, 'Person Name'], [180, 189, 'Status'], [228, 233, 'Person Name'], [238, 245, 'Person Name'], [293, 299, 'Person Name'], [364, 369, 'Person Name'], [405, 410, 'Person Name'], [606, 611, 'Person Name'], [928, 934, 'Person Name'], [937, 943, 'Person Name'], [948, 956, 'Person Name']]"

So we have decided that 40% of the transcript cleanup is good. So anuj uh sorry.

Yes yeah so this particular part i guess we need to make i mean uh as of now it is i mean the buttons colour and everything has been changed but it is still, it is looking like uh what Kajari gave us.

Yeah just take a hint from this and try to make it here, it is looking like a website. Okay. Okay but uh there it is looking like normal I mean what we say, the POC that we make or something we just made just for the showcase, not for the production level. Right? So in our case what is the issue? Is that here in our case, whatever, the models that we have built that models are not that much level because here we are trying to get the funding so we can not make the backend beautifiul. As of now, because we have the least time but if the frontend looks beautiful, then whatever is happening in the backend. That is the secondary part, because whatever we want to show, we have a script of that. And we will show that for the three meeting files, but if they are, as the, as the rule goes, right, the first impression is the last impression. So this UI is the first impression. So like the UI you made for the login screen, the home screen, sorry, where we are uploading. It looks like a website, even though maybe we need to change the color later based on the Anthem format, but it's still, it looks like a website, but the second is It looks like a temporary work.

"So this, uh, I mean, uh, we can say that for the last sprint UI wireframe has been completed, but for this sprint I have created a new user story only for the beautification part. So what I'm seeing, what I'm trying to say, uh, um, uh Suresh. Okay.  That, uh, one second. Okay. So if I look at your screen, and then if I look at my screen, one second, the screen which i have already made. So i now i am connected to wifi. So now, it will not be an issue.","[[135, 145, 'Scrum'], [235, 241, 'Person Name'], [83, 92, 'Status']]"

So if you see here, we have this thing also, and this thing also, but my website is also not looking professional and same I can say with yours as well, only for this page only for dashboard correct? So that's what. okay i'm trying to say. That uh the same thing what you have made on the same theme i have made as well. Maybe there are a few extra components here, but neither this is  required nor that is required. We want something on the theme of fireflies and otter. So that's why i have created the story as well. And, uh we can work on that together. So maybe we can connect daily.","[[570, 575, 'Scrum'], [516, 525, 'Tool']]"
Based on the theme of fireflies yeah,"[[22, 31, 'Tool']]"

"Yes sravanthi. So I guess yes so sravanthi, so the UI is ready only himanshu few changes, so that changes I can right.

So first I will be explaining the user story. Then I will be writing the description. Then together, we will come up with the acceptance criteria. And once we finish all of these things, then Sravanthi today only will have this new story point, uh, that only tool that you asked me i showed us the same tool yes using only? yes","[[223, 233, 'Scrum'], [381, 390, 'Person Name'], [391, 396, 'Date'], [421, 432, 'Scrum']]"

"11. 11 okay fine so um team, you decide shall we do for planIt poker last time as we did or is it okay because I think here the most decision should be taken by Suresh even thought the ownership lies across everybody and the team is working on it.

"So you Create a, you tell the user story and Suresh will come up with the acceptance criteria and. Got it. team. If you agree with the acceptance criteria or any questions on the acceptance criteria, you can ask suresh right now. Let's close it today or only now in this call, i will not schedule one more. okay got it.

"Okay okay So the first one is key frame, JSON creation and integration. So Amit,  I guess you have already done most of the work here. So the major thing is, uh, we have to integrate this JSON with Avinash.  So, uh, so majorly the team is uh I will tell you on one second. Yeah. So here, few buttons are going to come right as, uh,","[[75, 79, 'Person Name'], [198, 205, 'Person Name'], [107, 111, 'Status']]"
"Yeah. Yeah. So this below part. So if suppose a button is selected, suppose this one, then like this, it should get activated. So audio, video and snippets. Sorry. Yeah. Key frames. So if I click on this, then a pop up should come and where your all key frames should be coming. So now, uh, here, summary is there. So, uh, wherever you find that the screen is being shared. Okay. There, uh, in that particular, uh, what do we say? Um, um, if you look at the JSON, uh, we have the transcription JSON for each row. So for the transcription, JSON, for each row, if the screen is shared, there only the integration must be done for that particular row.  So are you getting me Amit? Yes yes yes so do you want me to show open the JSON and show it again? Yes yes definitely Okay um JSON i'll go to desktop.","[[672, 676, 'Person Name']]"
Yeah. Yeah. And then what were the things that we were having Amit? labels maybe label yeah,"[[62, 66, 'Person Name']]"
"Grey colour. Say maroon colour, if I click on this, so then himanshu sorry yes sravanthi","[[60, 68, 'Person Name'], [79, 88, 'Person Name']]"
Yes sravanthi.,"[[4, 13, 'Person Name']]"
Yes. So you have to write this logic and then you will have to put it in the Avinash code hmm okay so this transcription I'll send you,"[[77, 84, 'Person Name']]"
"Is this?I mean you, if you want Avinash to access this through an API which means he sends I guess that would be the best wat. So he sends uh JSON to your API and your API populates yeah like that transfers it to","[[32, 39, 'Person Name']]"
"The next person, I gues you will have to create another user story API creation","[[56, 66, 'Scrum']]"
Okay same thing I'll write here okay so so suresh what do you think it should be the acceptance criteria?,"[[43, 49, 'Person Name']]"
Uh yes himanshu so,"[[7, 15, 'Person Name']]"
"Himanshu so we can go ahead with the same things. So in, uh, what you were expecting, the same thing, we can accept it. Oh Sorry so I mean you can just uh tell me I will just type it","[[0, 8, 'Person Name']]"
"So the acceptance criteria, is that a, uh, once all of these points are successfully completed. Then only the user story will be markes as complete. Otherwise, if any 1 point is not completed yes correct","[[110, 120, 'Scrum']]"
Yes correct so all the stories so all the points should be in a like then it will be as happening. So then the user will get the success story correct yes,"[[23, 30, 'Scrum'], [137, 142, 'Scrum']]"
"Sounds good to Amit anything else to add? I guess it sounds good. Okay perfect so 3 story point game we will play at the end. So okay so now suresh this is yours only. So here you will have to, so this one I have created based on the revised wireframes that should come uh after you analyze yes otter and uh fireflies and you will make the changes so yeah","[[15, 19, 'Person Name'], [84, 95, 'Scrum'], [141, 147, 'Person Name'], [295, 300, 'Tool'], [308, 317, 'Tool']]"
Frames and uh generatoin of the HTML codes for the same so uh suresh can you give the,"[[62, 68, 'Person Name']]"
So I will send you the Anthem standard page and based on that you have to make the changes sure um himanshu,"[[23, 29, 'Organization'], [99, 107, 'Person Name']]"
So sravanthi I'm proceeding then yeah hmm yeah,"[[3, 12, 'Person Name']]"
"okay. So now comes the, okay. First I will move on to this last one where, so, avinash you will  have to, uh, talk with all the team members, whoever are the owners of, uh, their respective APIs and, uh, we have to stitch it now that routes that you were talking about that routes you will have to finish it","[[79, 86, 'Person Name']]"
So uh himanshu yeah one qucik question I'm sorry to interrupt but um,"[[6, 14, 'Person Name']]"
So suresh you are clear with the acceptance criteria,"[[3, 9, 'Person Name']]"
criteria and the story that is been given? Right so please raise uh if at all you find any anything more anymore story in detail you want to add let us know sure sravanthi now itself because it's in the planning phase yes yes you can always add 1 more story no problem in adding,"[[17, 22, 'Scrum'], [113, 118, 'Scrum'], [162, 171, 'Person Name'], [252, 257, 'Scrum']]"
Avinash. So you understand right? What we have to do,"[[0, 7, 'Person Name']]"
we decided right? Anuj or avinash? Uh Amit someone I guess amit amit comes from right position,"[[18, 22, 'Person Name'], [26, 33, 'Person Name'], [38, 42, 'Person Name'], [59, 63, 'Person Name'], [64, 68, 'Person Name']]"
So all of I mean what you have to do is everyone has an API right? hmm yes yes so once you have generated the JSON you create one more JSON okay you save it in mongo DB it's okay and you pass that JSON as in,"[[160, 168, 'Technologies']]"
JSON okay  you save it in Mongo DB it's okay and you pass that JSON as in as a post request to suppose uh divesh,"[[26, 34, 'Technologies'], [106, 112, 'Person Name']]"
You have to ensure that? Divesh team generates uh JSON okay okay and that JSON divesh team I mean divesh team,"[[25, 31, 'Person Name'], [79, 85, 'Person Name'], [98, 104, 'Person Name']]"
I mean divesh team saves it and in mongoDB and they forward it to suppose uh Amit Anuj,"[[7, 13, 'Person Name'], [35, 42, 'Technologies'], [77, 81, 'Person Name'], [82, 86, 'Person Name']]"
When anuj takes it and then gives another JSON and that passes to amit JSON okay okay and that JSON which is the final JSON,"[[5, 9, 'Person Name'], [66, 70, 'Person Name']]"
"which is the final JSON, which I will be, uh, taking care of. So, amit.","[[66, 70, 'Person Name']]"
Amit amit's API that will be the final API okay that we need to accept that the UI need to accept and that will be populated that will be used.,"[[0, 4, 'Person Name'], [5, 9, 'Person Name']]"
Okay that will be used to populate the UI I'm okay understood yes sir himanshu actually we have 2 options we can also pull it from Mongo DB like if you're passing as post or we can also pull it from mongo DB it can be from our escalation yes,"[[70, 78, 'Person Name'], [131, 139, 'Technologies'], [199, 207, 'Technologies']]"
So that means avinash saved it in mongo DB and then uh divesh will take it from mongo DB yeah divesh will save it in his collection,"[[14, 21, 'Person Name'], [34, 42, 'Technologies'], [55, 61, 'Person Name'], [80, 88, 'Technologies'], [94, 100, 'Person Name']]"
Hmm yeah divesh will take it in his collection and then Anuj will take it from divesh's collection and then I will take from collection,"[[9, 15, 'Person Name'], [56, 60, 'Person Name'], [79, 85, 'Person Name']]"
So how will divesh know that avinash has saved it in MongoDB,"[[12, 18, 'Person Name'], [29, 36, 'Person Name'], [53, 60, 'Technologies']]"
Avinash will run that code. So first divesh uh in the first Avinash API will run. If that completes then only uh divesh API will run okay,"[[0, 7, 'Person Name'], [37, 43, 'Person Name'], [60, 67, 'Person Name'], [113, 119, 'Person Name']]"
Uh divesh,"[[3, 9, 'Person Name']]"
"That means you are saying that. I mean, So Divesh, is it still using an API only, right? divesh is an API?","[[43, 49, 'Person Name'], [89, 95, 'Person Name']]"
Divesh is still using API and uh so divesh is a stand alone API,"[[0, 6, 'Person Name'], [36, 42, 'Person Name']]"
Not stand alone actually uh he has uh avinash has merged all the routes in 1 file and he's running that file hmm,"[[38, 45, 'Person Name']]"
Divesh route will not be called until and unless the JSON is saved in mongo DB yeah,"[[0, 6, 'Person Name'], [70, 78, 'Technologies']]"
Yes and also kind of like you can also run divesh first but we need uh I'm avinash's JSON that's uh us to decide but what to to but is the pipeline the sequence?,"[[43, 49, 'Person Name'], [75, 82, 'Person Name']]"
Please go ahead was like request will be saved in the collection of Avinash and then it will get to divesh we and divesh API will collect the uh JSON from avinash collection,"[[68, 75, 'Person Name'], [100, 106, 'Person Name'], [114, 120, 'Person Name'], [155, 162, 'Person Name']]"
Avinash can show you the process the code the request to get 1 he will maybe show you after this,"[[0, 7, 'Person Name']]"
Of routes that will tell that will ask the next API to start a second API's output JSON to we save in 1 mongo okay 3rd each API.,"[[104, 109, 'Technologies']]"
from the mongo DB collection for final API will be exposed publicly and UI will send a post only to that API which is Amit API okay,"[[9, 17, 'Technologies'], [118, 122, 'Person Name']]"
"Okay so regarding the transcript, you'll call only 1 APU that API will call amit's API that API will call anu's API like that you saying right? I will call only 1 API. That would give me the final output. Yes okay okay understood.","[[106, 109, 'Person Name'], [76, 80, 'Person Name']]"
That's when I'm saying so himanshu said we'll call,"[[26, 34, 'Person Name']]"
we'll call 1 API and internally we'll call 1 API and inside your API I will call anuk's API like that. So all the API's will be talking internally but publicly exposed API will be only 1 API yes okay,"[[81, 85, 'Person Name']]"
correct questions himanshu correct yes,"[[18, 26, 'Person Name']]"
Himanshu. Sorry to disturb yes yes I think we have a call with Kajari at 2 pm inform Kajari she said you can join this call now,"[[0, 8, 'Person Name'], [63, 69, 'Person Name'], [85, 91, 'Person Name']]"
