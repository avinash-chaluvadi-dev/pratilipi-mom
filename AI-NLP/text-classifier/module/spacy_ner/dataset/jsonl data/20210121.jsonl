{"id": 800, "data": "First I'll go. So it's about the, Bigbucket thing which I mentioned in the group in the morning. So I have created a Bitbucket. Actually, it was created a long time back, but we were not using it only, I guess Avinash and Anuj and Divesh, they only used it, Hrisheek but after that we stopped using it, but now we have to use it aggressively. So as, as I told in the group, uh, we have to create our own, branch , sometime so I am sharing my screen for sometime. Yeah. Yeah. So like in the topics extraction Bhanu and Divesh and  Hrisheek are working. So any one of you guys can create this branch, uh, from your terminal and then you put your good inside this. So how to put your code. As of now, you can proceed like this, source/ML/Divesh, and inside that Divesh's code.  So similarily, Hrisheek inside that Hrisheek code and like that source/ML/Bhanu and inside that Bhanus's code  for topics extraction, same goes with Label extraction, filters, video analysis, and like that for all the eight epics I have, uh, you have to create eight different feature branches. Now Uh, where is it, once one epic is done once topic extraction is done, then the last three user story is first conversion of your code and giving it a structure, right. And converting it into an API, then generating a standardized, JSON, and then finally storing it into Mongo DB. That means these three things require merging of work of Divesh, Hrisheek and Bhanu for topic extraction. So once this merge is done, once this API has been created and once the Mongo DB storage script has also been written. That means we have all the three things ready, Divesh code, Hrishhek code, Bhanu code, all  integrated, that should be kepy inside src/ml/final, that will be the final code, that will go, so later in the develop branch I will only look at the final section. Okay? This will be the onlyone only code i will be taking and putting into develop. So develop means we are starting the stitching of all these epics. Once all these epics are done, we will start stitching it. That will go in develop branch. Once everything is working perfectly in develop branch we will put it in the master branch. Now master branch is called the main branch. So we will put it in the main branch. So that will e the final code that we will be showing for Demos and later we are going to follow the same process. May be in future we are going to change this kind of structure, but as of now till this POC goes we will be following this structure. So I hope everyone is well versed with how to use github and bigbucket is nothing but github only,  it is given by aclasean. So those who dont know or have little, i am only talking about the development team, so those who dont know just go through an article, watch a video and then just learn how exactly pull push, creation of branches, everything is being done using terminal. So if you guys have any question just let me know.", "label": [[34, 43, "Tool"], [117, 126, "Tool"], [210, 217, "Person Name"], [222, 226, "Person Name"], [231, 237, "Person Name"], [258, 266, "Person Name"], [508, 513, "Person Name"], [518, 524, "Person Name"], [530, 538, "Person Name"], [735, 741, "Person Name"], [759, 767, "Person Name"], [790, 798, "Person Name"], [811, 819, "Person Name"], [849, 854, "Person Name"], [871, 879, "Person Name"], [999, 1004, "Scrum"], [1100, 1104, "Scrum"], [1164, 1174, "Scrum"], [1344, 1352, "Technologies"], [1411, 1417, "Person Name"], [1419, 1427, "Person Name"], [1432, 1437, "Person Name"], [1532, 1540, "Technologies"], [1626, 1632, "Person Name"], [1639, 1647, "Person Name"], [1654, 1659, "Person Name"], [1981, 1986, "Scrum"], [2003, 2008, "Scrum"], [2013, 2017, "Status"], [2553, 2559, "Tool"], [2564, 2573, "Tool"], [2589, 2595, "Tool"], [2618, 2626, "Tool"]]}

Because if you are not pushing your code and your system gets some issue, then entire effort is gone. And also when you are working on the server which is suppose AWS, then either you have to use WINSCP or Cyberduck to send your data from your system to AWS, but instead of that if your entire code is in Bigbucket, then all you have to do is GIT Clone, and then that will be a super fast process and that will also help in future CI-CD pipeline making, so always make an habbit, whatever code you write, working code, even though it has some kind of errors just keep on pushing it. Okay? As of now we are in the R&D phase. But whatever you put in that is being very closely monitored by the ANTHEM team. ANd then that code passes two kind of test, one is the Blue Optima test and second is the Sonar Cube test. And if you guys are failing in those tests, then it affects your appraisal and multiple other things. So as of now we are in the starting phase, so that Blue Optima and Sonar Qube will not come. But after the march POC and Demo, once we get the funding and once we get the anthem managers assigned and multiple other things, then all these things will come into picture.
