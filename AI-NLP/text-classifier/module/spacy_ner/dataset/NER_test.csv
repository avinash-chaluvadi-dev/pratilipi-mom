Yeah hi anuj this side,"[[8, 12, 'Person Name']]"
"Uh so regarding this I have like uh customise the code with the keys. So, the help with help of avijit yesterday soit's done you can move it to testig or tested I have to attache the documents still. Also sir has to see it's right I mean","[[96, 102, 'Person Name'], [154, 160, 'Status']]"

"First and second and she has to do the latter part and uh the user story nam uh, could we change it?","[[62, 72, 'Scrum']]"
So yeah Nikita you said to change the user story name. we will do that. So there was a lot of background noise. So that's the reason I asked you to go on mute. Okay anythint else from Nikita? I think you can pink Nikita,"[[8, 14, 'Person Name'], [38, 48, 'Scrum'], [184, 190, 'Person Name'], [213, 219, 'Person Name']]"
"So sarika? Coming to I recevied the two scripts Sravanthi, yesterday and today. So ill be working on labeling the script and uh yeah","[[48, 57, 'Person Name'], [3, 9, 'Person Name'], [59, 68, 'Date'], [73, 78, 'Date']]"
"No uh one question Sravanthi, I just had ato understand is when you click on my uh name and we have a meeting file labeling in to do and meeting 4 labeling in done. When you observe my page, right so my question here is when you click on the Nikita's name there is a meeting 4 labeling and meeting 5 labeling still in meeting 4 transcription and 5 in","[[19, 28, 'Person Name'], [242, 250, 'Person Name']]"
In this here either in to do or in-progress,"[[32, 43, 'Status']]"
"So that is. No no no I'll tell you what. No no no I'll tell you what. So this meeting transcription 4, this has a complete transcription half of your task and half od nikita's task","[[167, 173, 'Person Name']]"
"Oh no no I'll tell. I'm sorry I'm confusing you and I'm getting confused. So each week you are supposed to do 2scripts right? So in the 2 scripts instead of writing 8 I mean 2 each 2 2 that will be that should be coming up to 4 stories right. Instead of making 4 stories we have enhanced the story limit story points. Earlier it was 3, now it is 5. So Nikita can whatever Nikita is doing, the 2nd story, that will be updated here  only and meeting 5 will be having 2 sripts again. So that's the reason if you're completed you're story part here that means this complete labeling is done and okay my question is okay so hmm","[[226, 235, 'Scrum'], [261, 270, 'Scrum'], [372, 378, 'Person Name'], [397, 402, 'Scrum'], [304, 316, 'Scrum'], [352, 358, 'Person Name']]"
"Right. So actually this cannot be moved to done. It should be in in-progress. Hmm yeah. That's the reason just the story points is showing as 5. So the other day we were discussing in the same thing. Instead of having 4 user stories on each of you. Right. we thought 2 stories and we'll increase the story points. Because we have already started the sprint and if we start adding stories more it will be a scope change after the sprint is started, So that's the reason we have changed the story points.  So you are saying whatever a script, you are, the second script, which you are supposed to do, that should be coming into meeting 4 labeling","[[65, 76, 'Status'], [115, 127, 'Scrum'], [267, 276, 'Scrum'], [218, 232, 'Scrum'], [300, 312, 'Scrum'], [380, 387, 'Scrum'], [489, 501, 'Scrum']]"
So uh so what we can do is we I'll just check if we can move it back to in-progress hmm I'll just check and let you know,"[[72, 83, 'Status']]"
Now that I think Nikita had submitted two scripts right? Right the second,"[[17, 23, 'Person Name']]"
"Yeah, the second one after you do this second one this story will be moving to done. Yeah sure. Only one you have done and it is moved to done no. No it should be having the 2nd script also in this.

Avijit you're still there cool okay girls tell me yes sravanthi,"[[0, 6, 'Person Name'], [54, 63, 'Person Name']]"
"Dhanuj anythinf pending from your side? No himanshu no. so whatever you have done you have already shared with me. Yeah I have sent you, if you guys shared me on teams or mail? I shared teams you on teams teams okay yeah fine okay Avinash? Anything pending from your side? not pending from my not pending anything but uh i need to check how much time it takes for different size of video files","[[0, 6, 'Person Name'], [43, 51, 'Person Name'], [231, 238, 'Person Name']]"
"But, uh, the video, uh, uh, uh, which I have uploaded is through postman's. So maybe it took long time. Now we are uploading through the website. Okay.","[[65, 74, 'Tool']]"
But uh uploading through website is taking less time than uploading through postman,"[[76, 83, 'Tool']]"
"task is done, right. And it's getting uploaded. And a, as it is uploaded, it is starting the containers. Uh, speech man container. Hmm correct  And Once it is, once everything is done, are you sending any flag back so that the UI knows that everything is done and the buttons should be activated yeah","[[8, 12, 'Status']]"
Okay so now then if this is done so next let's come to divesh,"[[55, 61, 'Person Name']]"
Oh divesh and hrishee uh so I guess you guys are done with the upload part and everything and how about the pending task? So I mean which is coffee or something?,"[[3, 9, 'Person Name'], [14, 21, 'Person Name']]"
Yeah himanshu nothing,"[[5, 13, 'Person Name']]"
"the upload file is almost done. So we are trying to some add some 75 components on the to beautify the upload page, with some gifs and some images. Like, Kajari said we need to add some graphic things on. Um, on then inter pipeline so currently we are doing now","[[154, 160, 'Person Name']]"
by end of the day or tomorrow morning it will be done. Perfect so avinash you have that key so we have to think of a,"[[66, 73, 'Person Name'], [21, 29, 'Date']]"
"of a scenario where like every minute or every five minutes, a request is sent to, uh, the Mongo DB, API which avinash has created for talking with mongo and it should and we should check that JSON if ready tag ready is false than the button should not be active, if ready is true then button should be active.","[[91, 99, 'Technologies'], [111, 118, 'Person Name'], [148, 153, 'Technologies']]"
So that means you're doing with you and hrisheek both are doing this task. Right? Yes himanshu yeah so what so then I will work on this logic,"[[40, 48, 'Person Name'], [86, 94, 'Person Name']]"
avinash by what time uh this is ready? Tag will be done?,"[[0, 7, 'Person Name']]"
Let me knowo okay? So I have a doubt. So if you add a ready tag so you um what what are you doing? You calling API or mongo DB collection right?,"[[118, 126, 'Technologies']]"
Mongo DB I will be calling your API which talks with the mongo DB collection,"[[0, 8, 'Technologies'], [57, 65, 'Technologies']]"
You gave me an API right. Which gives me the mongo DB JSON,"[[45, 53, 'Technologies']]"
Okay so Amit anything pending from your side? Yeah,"[[8, 12, 'Person Name']]"
