In this subject of application, we explored tests and views with Django projects.

We focused on:
Why would anyone want to write automated tests
What kinds of tests are useful to a Django Keyframe Extractor Classifier ml app

By Deploying the application with a Python web application server (i.e., ./manage.py runserver isnâ€™t meant for deployed apps)

Deployment preconditions for managing settings, migrations, and static files
A checklist to confirm that your settings are configured with the proper security guards
Monitoring your application for errors, etc.
